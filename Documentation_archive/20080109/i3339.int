BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Existing projects are not updated with the new export_builder


1. Abstract
-----------
Add support for automatically updating the .project file of MC3020 projects to
include the export builder.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 3339
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3339

4. Background
-------------
See [2].

5. Design
---------
See [2].

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1     MC3020Nature.java
6.1.1   Added hasBuilder() function to query if a given project has a given
        builder.
6.1.2   Removed cases where non-existence of expected builders results in an
        error.  We expect this to happen sometimes.  Now we just handle it.

6.2     MC3020ResourceListener.java
6.2.1   Added check for the proper builders when a project that was previously
        closed is opened.

6.3     ModelCompiler.java
6.3.1   Added code to check for the proper builders in MC3020 projects at
        eclipse startup time.
6.3.2   Added a support function to display a Yes/No dialog to ask the user
        the upgrade question.

7. Unit Test
------------
See tests in [2, section 9].
