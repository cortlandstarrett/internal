BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Prevent unnecessary persistence during paste

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to prevent persisting model files which
are not participating in a paste.

4. Background
-------------
In certain circumstances it is possible to cause persistence to a project when
pasting data into another project.

5. Design
---------
5. Prevent updating model-root id for default root

5.1 Do not change default root id

During a paste the tool will temporarily place the pasted elements onto the
destination model-root.  When pasting system level elements this model-root is
the default root.  A listener, OoaofooaBase.ModelChangeListener, will call a
method which will in turn update a model-root id if the root element's name has
changed.  This listener is being called for the unique name setting that is
occuring during the paste.  This results in two separate issues, one is that the
id of the default root should never change.  The second issue is more specific
to this issue.  The code which updates the model-root id searches the instance
database for a root element.  This causes loading of all element's in the
workspace with that type.  This is due to the design of the loading code, if the
model-root is the default-root then all persistable model components of that
type are loaded.

During the loads upgrade code is being called which in turn creates and relates
instances.  In normal loading situations the tool is not notified of these
creates and relates.  During a paste there is a transaction running which picks
up the deltas for these changes.  This raises another issue with the tool which
has been captured in [2].

A simple test is added to the OoaofooaBase.updateId method to return without
doing any work if the root id is that of the default root.

5.2 Remove unnecessary select

During the investigation it was noticed that a select from instances of S_DT was
present in the S_SYS.pasteComponentPackage operation.  This select was not
needed and was causing unnecessary loading.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
Manual test:

_- Check out bp.core, bp.welcome, and bp.ui.canvas
_- Create a new project (src)
_- create an interface package (ip1)
_- create an interface (i1)
_- create a component pkg (cp1)
_- create component (c1)
_- c1 provides and requires i1
_- create nested component in c1 (cn1)
_- delegate from both interface references to the nested component
_- create a new project (target)
_- copy cp1 to target
_R None of the checked out projects are dirtied
