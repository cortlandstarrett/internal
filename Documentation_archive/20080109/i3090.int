BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Unformalize interface reference if already formalized

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to properly support re-formalization of
an interface reference.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 3090
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com//bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3090

4. Background
-------------
Currently re-formalizing an interface reference causes duplicate graphics to
exist.

5. Design
---------
5.1 Unformalize interface reference before formalizing

At one point the tool properly supported re-formalization of interface
references.  In the lastest code there is no call to unformalize the interface
reference if already formalized.  This has the effect of not removing any
imported references that are referring to the newly formalized interface
reference.  This leaves the imported component with duplicate imported reference
instances.

A call is added to unformalize the interface reference if already formalized to
the requested interface.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
_- Create a component with a formal interface reference
_- Create an imported component which imports the component
   above
_- Re-formalize the formal interface reference
_R There is only one imported reference on the imported component
