BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Set graphical represents before reconciling

deletions caused by the auto reconciler.

----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 3080
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com//bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3080

4. Background
-------------
[1] describes an issue where connectors are removed on a diagram when another
diagram is deleted.

5. Design
---------
5.1 Set graphical represents before checking connectors during auto
		reconciliation
		
The reason for the unwanted deletions is that the check for existing metamodel
elements is using null UUIDs.  The reason for the null UUIDs is that the
graphical elements do not have their represents set yet.

The operations in the GD_ARS class are changed to set the graphical represents
value before auto-reconciling.
