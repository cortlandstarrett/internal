6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 A change was made in Instance.initialize() to resolve issue dts0100655243 
    [2] by assuring all unique id attributes are initialized even if they are 
    not part of an identifier. 
    In Instance.initialize() (line #'s refer to Rev 1.17)
    Remove line 19.
    Modify line 28 to remove 'and not_empty oida'.
    This will ensure that all unique id attributes are initialized, even if 
    they are not part of an identifier.

7. Unit Test
------------
Outline all the unit tests that need to pass and describe the method that you
used to design and perform the tests. If the unit test section in the design
note is elaborate enough, you may choose to simply point the reader to the
