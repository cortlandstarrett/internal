BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Update expected results for long running CCP tests

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to update the long running CCP test
expected results.

2. History

4. Background
-------------
There are three tests that take a long time to run, these tests have not had
their expected results updated as they are excluded from the default j-unit test
run.  The CQ QA system has a test which enables these and re-runs the test
suite.  These three tests were failing as they needed their test results
updated.

5. Design
---------
5.1 Update expected results

The test result creator was run.  Below is a list of differences:

ModelRecreation_39

The results for this test changed due to the following:
  - Updated default diagram size to be fixed at 8000,6000
  - Initial expected results included a bug in the graphics reconciler which
    incorrectly added nested subsystems to the root diagram
  - Default data type package use to be selected in during the result generation
    causing additional draw commands for resize handles

ModelRecreation_58

The results for this test changed due to the following:

  - Updated default diagram size to be fixed at 8000,6000
  - Default data type package use to be selected in during the result generation
    causing additional draw commands for resize handles

ModelRecreation_61

The results for this test changed due to the following:

	- Test results were never correct, the pasted graphics previously were not
	  included in the draw commands.
	  
In addition to updating the expected results the class, ModelRecreationTests,
was modified to run the model compare before comparing graphical output.  This
allows us to see if there are any database errors during the paste before
failing on graphical changes.  Graphical changes can occur through the history
of the graphics plug-in and not necessarily indicate a bug.

6. Implementation Comments
