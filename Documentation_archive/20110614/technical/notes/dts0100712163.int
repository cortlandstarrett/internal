BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
BridgePoint requires administrator's privileges to install MSC++ Redistributable

1. Abstract
-----------
Saab configures their user access such that they want to be able to install 
BridgePoint without having to have administrator privileges.  The primary reason
they have problems is the installation of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistribut-
able package. This note describes how we will resolve the issue.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------

4. Background
-------------
The Saab situation is captured in the description of the issue in [1].

5. Design
---------
5.1  Moved the installation of the MSVC Redist Package to the end of the post
     installation script.  The user will still see an error when attempting to
     install as a non-admin user, but the other post-install processing will
     now complete and the user should be left with a runnable BridgePoint.
  
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1  Another suggestion was to query the user in the installer GUI whether they
     wanted to install the MSVC package or not.  It was determined that we did
     not want to add a potentially confusing query to the user.  In addition, we
     did not want users choosing not to install the package when it is actually 
     needed.

6.2  A note will be added to the release notes describing that an error may
     occur when installing as a non-admin and where to find the MSVC package to
     install later as an admin if necessary.

6.3  We will pursue a better understanding of what parts of BridgePoint 
     (licensing, EDGE, other?) require the MSVC redist package.  This issue will
     remain open and serve as a hub for our exploration and communication with
     the teams that control those components.
6.3.1  Based on our findings, we may change how, when, or even if we continue to
       install the MSVC redist.
               
7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Run the installer, verify that the MSVC install is run after the release
     notes are displayed.
