BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Fix long filenames created when editing Transition actions.

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to fix the problems caused by very long
filenames created for transition action editor.

2. History
----------
.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] ClearQuest DEI dts0100655323 - Long filenames from events cause problems in
    Builder and Verifier

4. Background
-------------
The customer reported being unable to set a breakpoint in a transition action.

5. Analysis
------------
On examination of the model, it was seen that the event assigned to the
transition carried 11 parameters, some with quite long names. It was found that
the name being used for the transition activity place holder file was being
derived from a call to get_connector_text. This includes the names and types of
all the parameters. The Windows filename length is limited to 255 characters. It
is this length that is being exceeded and causing the reported failure.

Since there is no need to include the parameter names in this name, the 
recommended fix is to exclude this data.

As a side effect, these changes improve the appearance of transition action
editors by shortening their titles. The appearance of breakpoints in the Break-
point View is similarly enhanced.

6. Design
---------
The following changes are needed:

6.1 Transition
In Transition.get_name(), change the call to get_connector_text() in New State
Transition to use the get_name() operation instead.

6.2 New State Transition
Add a new operation get_name() to satisfy the requirements of the above change.
The body for this operation should be the same as that for New State Transition.
get_connector_text() except that the calls to get_event_text() are replaced with
calls to get_name().

6.3 Creation Transition
In Creation Transition.get_name(), change the call to get_event_text() to
get_name().

7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
7.1 Signal Event
This class also needs a get_name operation. It is a copy of get_event_text()
without the code that adds the parameters.

7.2 Test expected result changes
Some tests track the calls made internally by the tool to assure correct
behavior. Where the results include getting the name for a transition, the
expected results were changed to match. The Body class has a derived attribute
which contains its label. Some tests check a model file which includes instances
of Body. Where these are persisted, their derived Label attribute now differs
these expected model files are updated to match the new results.

8. Unit Test
------------
8.1 All existing unit tests must pass.

8.2 Add new large Event Data Item list test
A new test will be added in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test to confirm that
transition activities can have breakpoints added to them.

9. Code Changes
---------------
Branch name: Review-dts0100655323
NOTE: io.mdl.test is branched only at the expected_results folder due to a CVS
problem.
