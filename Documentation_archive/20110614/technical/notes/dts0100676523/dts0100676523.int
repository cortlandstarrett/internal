BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Invalid parameter(s) in Variable window.

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the implementation carried out for fixing the incorrect 
displaying of event's parameter(s) while executing inside an operation context
that was called from a state/transition action context.  

2. History

4. Background
-------------
When executing in the context of an Operation Activity that was called from 
within the context of a state or a transition action, the Variables window 
incorrectly displays parameter(s) from the incoming signal to the caller state
or transition.

5. Design
---------
5.1 debug.ui.model.BPStackFrame.getVariables()
This function used to traverse to the current executing event, then creates a 
new BPVariable(s) with the data item value(s) related with this event, to be 
displayed in the variables view.
If the execution of the state/transition action is interrupted by an operation 
call, this traversal still returns the executing event of the caller 
state/transition.
As a fix for this, this function should check that the current action body is 
either a state action body or transition action body, before fetching the 
current executing event.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------


7. Unit Test
------------
_- Create a class called class1
_- Create a class operation called Op1
_- Insert the following OAL inside Op1
   a = 1;
   b = 2;
_- Put a breakpoint at the first line in Op1.
_- Create another class operation called Op2 with two parameters called 
   opIntPar of type int and opStrPar of type String.
_- Insert the following OAL inside Op2
   a = 1;
   b = 2;
_- Put a breakpoint at the first line in Op2.
_- Create an ISM inside class1 with 2 states A and B.
_- Create a transition from A to B.
_- Create an Event E1 with a parameter named evIntPar which is of type int, and 
   another parameter called evStrPar of type string.
_- Assign E1 to the transition between States A and B.
_- Put the following OAL in state B and in the transition from A and B.
   select any class1 from instances of CLASS1;
   class1.Op1();
   class1.Op2(opIntPar:10,opStrPar:"testStrOp");
_- Put breakpoints at the first line inside the OAL of the transition and 
   state actions.
_- Execute a verifier function that creates an instance of class1 and 
   generates E1 to it with two values of the evIntPar and evStrPar parameters 
   (1 ,"testStrEv").
_R The breakpoint at the transition action is hit and in the variables view 
   evIntPar and evStrPar are shown with the passed values (1 , "testStrEv").
_- Resume execution to the call of Op1.
_R The breakpoint at the first line in Op1 is hit and nothing is viewed at the
   variables view.
_- Resume execution to the call of Op2.
_R The breakpoint at the first line in Op2 is hit and in the variables view 
   opIntPar and opStrPar are shown with the passed values (10 , "testStrOp").
_- Resume execution and repeat for the operations calls from within the state 
   action.
