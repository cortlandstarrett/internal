BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
MC3020 fails to generate code for AUTOSAR


1. Abstract
-----------
TE_C::ComponentName is accessed during code generation, but the field does not
exist. This note describes how the error came about and how the fix was
implemented.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] DEI dts0100703434 - MC3020 fails to generate code for AUTOSAR
[2] DEI dts0100564015 - Add component support to MC-3020.
[3] DEI dts0100632984 - Update MCs to work with proposed meta-model change
[4] http://beta.wv.mentorg.com/tenmile_svn/tenmile/trunk/Models/Demo/SeatHeater

4. Background
-------------
4.1 A bug in MC3020 was discovered when attempting to generate code for the 
    SeatHeater test model [4]. Errors pop up during code generation indicating
    that te_c.ComponentName is invalid.
4.1.1 The bug is specific to AUTOSAR or VFB tasking, which is used in the
      SeatHeater demo model for VSI.
      
4.2 TE_C was added to the model compiler meta-model as part of the work to add
    component support to the MC [2].  It first appeared in xtumlmc_schema.sql
    v1.27.2.1 on 4/24/09.
4.2.1 After searching through the history, it was found that ComponentName was
      never an attribute of TE_C and still is not.
      
4.3 There were changes to the model compiler metamodel done as part of [3]. Part
    of this work was to combine TE_DOM and TE_C.
4.3.1 Historically, t.component.ports.c used the name value found in
      te_c.DomainName.
4.3.2 When the work for [3] was done, the name used in t.component.ports.c was
      incorrectly changed to te_c.ComponentName.
4.3.2.1 After inspection, it was confirmed that all of the invalid ComponentName
        uses were enclosed within a block that could only be entered if AUTOSAR
        or VFB tasking were in use.
        
5. Design
---------
5.1 Search for all places where the name is pulled from TE_C
5.1.1 Searched all the archetype files for "te_c.*Name", found 133 matches.
5.1.2 Inspected each hit. In all cases except in t.component.ports.c, the name
      value is retrieved from te_c.Name.

5.2 In file t.component.ports.c replaced all occurrences of te_c.ComponentName 
    with te_c.Name.
 
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Test SeatHeater
    _- Run the new SMA QA - BP test case dts0100731440
     
8. Code Changes
---------------
Branch name: R3_2_1-MN-dts0100703434
