BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Enhance problem marker behavior

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes changes that are required to enhance the behavior of the
problem marker code.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
It was noticed that we were ignoring proxy creation events during model file
replacement.  This was added to prevent showing errors when there were not any,
see [3].  However, this is one of the most important times to handle these
events.  We need to handle the case where a user replaces a model file with one
that removes or adds a required referred to element.  I am unable to reproduce
the original issue at this time.  It is believed that the problem marker code at
the state during [3] had something else incorrect which caused the errors to
show incorrectly.  The reproduction steps in [3] are now impossible to complete,
so instead the datatypes file was deleted as a test.  The errors show and go
away as necessary.

The archetype, gen_import_java.arc, in io.core is modified to remove the setting
of the collectNextProxy flag.  This will allow proxy creation events to be
processed when we clear the database (existing load of the model file).

A couple of canvas tests were failing inconsistently.  It turned out that a
display event was being handled at different times which caused different
results for positional values.  To fix this we need to process all pending
display events before adjusting the scroll positions in
CanvasTestUtils.matchCanvasSpaceToModelSpace().

[4] covered some work to allow certain tests to pass by updating the expected
results.  However, it was never promoted.  It will be along with this issue.
