    This technical note holds observations related to the generic package
    work (dts0100631941).

4. Background
-------------
For the BP 3.1.2 release generic package functionality was turned off by 
removing the generic package functionality in the UI (modifying 
bp.graphics/plugin.xml) [2].  Generic package functionality is a major feature 
of the summer 2010 release and must now be enabled again to allow development 
to proceed.

5. Design
---------
5.1 The changes made to bp.ui.graphics/plugin.xml to disable generic package [2]
    functionality shall be reverted.  
5.2 A bridge operation named PREF::genericsEnabled() was introduced by [2] to force 
    a few places in OAL to not go through OAL that was introduced for generic package 
    functionality.  This bridge operation shall modified to always return true.
5.2.1 A separate issue is raised [5, 6.31] to remove the PREF::genericsEnabled() 
    operation and examine and update the places that call it accordingly.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 bp.core.test/arc/create_action_test.arc was modified to remove a 
    special-case that prevented the ActionTest.java:testNewEP_PKGFunction()
    test from being generated.  Now that generic package functionality is 
    enabled that special case is no longer needed and in fact we do want to 
    test that it is possible to create a Function inside a EP_PKG.
6.2 The Nature tests are failure and should be removed from the test template
    by the promoter of this issue.  The tests to remove are:
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.test
          Workspace Setup
          Existing Projects
    These Nature tests must be rewritten now that generic package
    functionality is enabled [4].  For now these test are being removed from 
    the test template (as they were prior to the BP 3.1.2 release) [3].   These 
    tests were put back into the unit test suite because we disabled generic 
    package functionality prior to the BP 3.1.2 release.  The reason these 
    tests must be rewritten is that they rely heavily on the ability to create
    specialized packages inside of a generic package, and that ability is gone
    with the introduction of generic packages.


7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 All unit tests must pass.  
7.1.1 The test results have been checked in and there are a few failures.  They
    are:
     pixel compare differences 
     verifier tests are not consistent
     tiger nature test problem [6.2].
