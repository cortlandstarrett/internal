BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Degraded Generator Performance


1. Abstract
-----------
The generator performance has been reported by customers as having serious 
degradation between BridgePoint releases 2.0.3 and 2.1.1.  This note describes
the work that was done to analyze the situation and get some speed back.

2. History
----------
None.

4. Background
-------------
Ericsson claims and severe slowdown in generator between BridgePoint 2.0.3 and 
2.1.1.  Robert Rice confirmed he saw a (less severe) slowdown as well.  We need
to investigate and find out what can be done to improve performance.  As part
of this issue, we need to stop building generator on developer machines and
start building it on our svr-azt-eng-01 build server.

5. Analysis
-----------
5.1  Version numbers
5.1.1  BP 2.0.3, released  6/08, contained generator 1.34
5.1.2  BP 2.1.1, released 12/08, contained generator 1.36

5.2  Binary code differences
5.2.1  File sizes of shipped gen_erate.exe
        2.0.3: 4,136,960 bytes
        2.1.1: 4,476,928 bytes
        
        Keith M4400:
            2.0.3: 4,833,280 bytes (Release)
                   5,804,136 bytes (Debug)
            2.1.1: 4,829,184 bytes (Release)

        Keith D600:
            2.0.3: 4,136,960 bytes (Release)
            2.1.1: 4,136,960 bytes (Release)
                   5,800,040 bytes (Debug)
          
        Bob D800:
            2.1.1: 4,145,152 bytes (Release)
                   5,828,720 bytes (Debug)
                     
5.3  Source code differences
5.3.1  Generator
5.3.1.1  The only non-whitespace diff between the "model_compilers/generator" 
         source trees of the two versions is the version number change.
5.3.2  MC-3020
5.3.2.1  The changes to MC-3020 between 2.0.3 and 2.1.1 were for BZ3609 "MC PEIs
         Reborn in Verifier" [2].  This change touched the following files:
            mc3020/arc/bridge.arc
            mc3020/arc/domain.arc
            mc3020/arc/obj_factory.arc
            mc3020/arc/pei.arc
            mc3020/arc/sys_util.arc
            mc3020/arc/template.sys_factory.c
            mc3020/schema/colors/domain.mark
            mc3020/schema/sql/xtumlmc_schema.sql
5.3.3  MC-2020
5.3.3.1  No differences.
      
5.4  Computer differences
5.4.1  There is no record of who or where the generator EXE is built.  It was 
       either built by Bob or Keith on a local machine, not the build server.
5.4.2  Keith got his M4400 laptop in October 2008.  This is in-between releases
       and raises a flag about being a contributing factor. If Keith built the
       2.0.3 generator it was done on his D600 laptop.  However, if Keith built
       the 2.1.1 generator it could have been done on either machine.
5.4.3  Bob got his M6400 laptop in January 2009, so if he built the generator it
       was on his D800 laptop.
       
         
6. Design
---------
6.1  Configured the build server svr-azt-eng-01 with MS Visual Studio Pro and 
     Visual Studio Service Pack 6
     
6.2  Configure the build server for building the generator.  Build it.

6.3  Performance Analysis
6.3.1  Use two of the "generator teaching exercise" archetype files to test the
       performance of the generator alone without the model compilers playing a 
       role.  We tested the model compiler run from the command line and did not
       have eclipse running at all.  Processing and memory results were captured
       using the "Process Explorer" utility [3].
       
       Note how HEAD test of Ericsson model is 4.087s run time for ex10.arc. 
       This beats the BP 2.0.3 generator (5.288s) and blows prior BP 3.1.5 
       generator out of the water (10.249s, 2.5x slower).  The results do 
       confirm a serious slowdown between 2.0.3 and 2.1.1.

6.4  Put the new generator into the nightly build at tucson:/arch1/products/
        tiger/extra_files_for_build.  Back up the prior version to old_files/.
        
6.5  Put the new generator into use on the build server by putting it in
        c:\utilities\bp_build_tools\bridgepoint

Results Matrix
---------------
HEAD = generator 1.57 that was built on the build server (and now in the nightly build as of 9/20). Comes from MS Visual Studio 6 Pro with Service Pack 6.

6.6  It is my opinion that the many configuration variables between the various 
     developer machines (OS service pack level, MS Visual Studio version, MS
     Visual Studio service pack level) has led to some less than optimal builds
     of the generator.  The results show that our build server setup (MS Visual
     Studio Pro with MSVS SP6) produces a small and speedy generator.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Use the new generator and the prior generator.  Build MicrowaveOven and GPS
    Watch sample projects.  Compare the output source and verify no differences.
    
7.2 Use the new generator and the prior generator.  Build bp.core in the devel-
    opment environment.  Compare the output java source code and verify no
    differences.
