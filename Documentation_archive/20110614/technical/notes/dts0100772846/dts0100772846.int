BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Problems with elements nested under a component within generic packages

1. Abstract
-----------
A lot of OAL in ooaofooa that is used to navigate from nested components into 
the component's containing package is incorrect.  This issue is raised to 
describe and resolve these problems.

Additionally, three other small issues were resolved in this branch and should
be resolved with this work [3] [4] [5].

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 job:dts0100772846
    The Component Reference.actionFilter was completely wrong for the  
    assign generic pkg case.  It has been rewritten.  
    
    This  operation gets a list of all components that are visible from the 
    current package.  Of course this list this must include components outside 
    the current package.  After it gets this list, it checks to see which 
    components have matching interfaces, and it filters-out those that do not.  
    It also filters out any component in the same package.
    
6.2 Assign Component causes tool to hang [3]

    In Component Refernce.assignToCom Modifed the code to check for the 
    isInGenericPackage case before it falls into SP code that makes not sense 
    for the isInGenericPackage case.
    
6.3 Wrong data type for created Property Parameter in GP [4]

    In Property Parameter.initialize I changed the default data type in the GP 
    case from void to integer. It now matches the SP case.

6.4 Toward the end of the work it was observed that the last line of this CQ
    issue's description [1] described a problem that was different then the 
    others.  This problem was that the properties view was not allowing 
    datatypes to be viewed and set when the model element with the S_DT
    is under a component which is under a package.

    Fixed several problems in the generation of getPropertyDescriptors() that 
    were causing the properties view to not allow the user to see and select 
    datatypes under components inside of generic packages.   The problems 
    fixed were:
6.4.1  The was a situation where the visibility collections were not being 
    populated prior to being used.  For this case, I used the existing 
    RSL function, generate_package_query to make this happen.
6.4.2 In generate_package_query the PE_SRS search result was being used, but 
    the PE_CRS search result was not.  This resulted in lists coming up 
    empty when they should not have.
6.4.3 In generate_package_query we now use 
    getInstanceList(DataType_c.class).getGlobal(dtID) to search for the data 
    type where previously we were only searching the model root of the 
    current instance.  When nested, the datatypes may not be in the same model 
    root.
6.5 GP Importer can leave duplicate symbols on system diagram
    In UpdateHelper.java::upgradeToGenerics I removed 2 calls 
    addGraphicsToSystem that were not needed and were resulting in duplicate 
    graphics being created.  A third modification was made to remove a place 
    where this call had already been commented-out, but the commented-out code 
    was left behind (I removed this commented-out call).   The reason this is 
    not needed is that the upgrade  calls update the existing graphics, so 
    there is no need to create new graphics.  In fact, it is better not to 
    create them if we don't have to because by reusing the existing 
    graphics element placement remains the same.

Revision 1.6  2011/05/26 21:58:45  rmulvey
job:dts0100773077
In UpdateHelper.java::upgradeToGenerics I was too aggressive in the removal of calls to addGraphicsToSystem the one that is used after upgradeDomain Is needed.  I put it back.  When this action was performed, the test result did not need to be updated.

Revision 1.5  2011/05/26 17:08:25  rmulvey
job:dts0100773077
Updated implementation note to account for updaetd expected results because the duplicate graphics is no longer present.

Revision 1.4  2011/05/26 15:57:34  rmulvey
job:dts0100773077
Updated this note to include the 3-line change made to resolve this issue.

Revision 1.3  2011/05/26 11:11:58  rmulvey
job:dts0100772846
Updated the chaged file list and added a description for the change that fixes the properties view.

Revision 1.2  2011/05/26 05:26:15  rmulvey
job:dts0100772846 dts0100773489 dts0100773494
Updated the implementation note with the final changes.

Revision 1.1  2011/05/25 02:24:49  rmulvey
job:dts0100772846
Introduced
