BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Prevent Eclipse Job flooding and Dispose Timers properly

1. Abstract
-----------
This note addresses the causes of the BridgePoint UI becoming unresponsive and
also assures that the Verifier timer infrastructure does not hang because
timers are incompletely disposed.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
Two unexpected test failures were encountered during testing of this work:

6.1 Model change enable without preceding disable error
This is thrown by a new piece of assurance infrastructure introduced by this
work[3,6.3]. It correctly detected some faulty model change enablement in the
io.mdl.ModelImportWizard. This class is reworked to use a safe try-finally
clause to disable and enable model change events during load. The original piece
of code disabled the model changes on one thread and then enabled them on
another. This is not recommended and is detected as an error, so the code is
changed to enable and disable the change events in both threads separately. Both
use the try-finally idiom to assure changes are re-enabled no matter what faults
might be encountered.

6.2 Expected an error log containing messages: \"Unable to locate PMC\
This error was reported by StaleProxyExportTest after the fix detailed above was
introduced[6.1]. Investigation showed that this test was partially incorrect and
was failing for the wrong reasons. If it had been working correctly, this test
would have failed and been addressed two years ago with the promotion of [6].
Further, the symptoms can be shown to exist in HEAD by removing preceding tests.
The reason the change above caused the test to fail is that listeners that were
logging errors are correctly no longer invoked and the error log is empty. The
failing part of this test is commented out and an issue raised to track fixing
this test[5].
