BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Update docgen to work with generic packages


1. Abstract
-----------
The BridgePoint documentation creation tool does not currently work with models 
that contain generic packages.  This note describes the work done to enhance the
tool to work with these models.

2. History
----------
None.

4. Background
-------------
The documentation tool consists of several parts:
  - "Create Documentation" context menu action : this task is housed in the 
      bp.docgen plugin.  It calls the other tools used in the flow.
      
  - image creation : this task is in the bp.io.image plugin.  It creates pngs
      for the various canvases in the model
      
  - export builder : The pre-builder is used to gather the model into a single
      file that is used in the rest of the flow
      
  - xtumlmc_build : used to process the model to remove unnecessary instance
      data and convert UUIDs to short ints

  - docgen.exe : a model-based model compiler that is built from a special 
      model compiler branch of bp.core (in this case branch MC-C).

  - xsltproc : open-source software that is used to convert the XML output from
      docgen into HTML.  We are using version 1.1.24 of libxslt.  The official 
      distribution is 1.1.26, but the changes are very minor so an update to
      what we currently ship does not appear worthwhile.

The docgen.exe is currently built in a Windows environment and the restriction
remains that BridgePoint Document Generation only works on Windows-based 
BridgePoint installs.  We have an open issue to expand support to Linux [2].
That issue is not addressed by this work and remains open.

Issue [3] is not fixed with this work, but the refactoring done by this 
work will aid in making a clean fix for this in the future.

Issue [4] is not fixed with this work.

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1  Process models that contain generic packages only. Display appropriate HTML
     output.
     
5.2  Process models that contain specific packages only. Display appropriate 
     HTML output.
     
5.3  Process models that contain a mixture of generic and specific packages.
     Display appropriate HTML output.

 
6. Work Performed
-----------------
6.1  bp.docgen plug-in
6.1.1  Removed the hook that looks for and disallows models that contain generic 
       packages.
6.1.2  Updated the code that finds the location of xtumlmc_build.exe by looking
       at the model compiler launch file.  The new code accounts for both the
       old-style and new-style model compiler launch file.  
       
6.2  bp.mc plug-in
6.2.1  Updated the bp.mc::AbstractNature.getLaunchAttribute() function to be 
       static.
  
6.3  bp.core plug-in
6.3.1  This work exposed the fact that the generated "<Element>Inspector" 
       getParentElement() functions were not handling component parent/child
       relationships through Packageable Element.
6.3.2  Updated ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql to include traversals from Component
       to the following children through PE_PE:
         - Package
         - Component
         - Imported Component
         - Interface
         - User Data Type

6.4  bp.ui.properties plug-in
6.4.1  Due to the changes in 6.3.2, some special casing code in 
       BuildPropertySource.arc that handled the Component-to-Component relation-
       ship was able to be removed.  A small special case to modify the name 
       shown in the properties view is added.  This can be removed when specific
       packages are removed from the tool.

6.5  bp.core plug-in, MC-C model compiler branch
6.5.1  Updated instructions for creating a model compiler branch (like this MC-C
       branch).
6.5.2  Renamed README.txt to "HOWTO Create docgen exe.txt", added more detail
       to instructions.
6.5.3  External entities
6.5.3.1  The C model compiler was changed to increase "modularization" around
         the same time the work in this note was done.  The end result of the
         MC work was that the EEs are generated differently.  For example, the
         Template (T) EE is now generated to functions named ooaofooa_T_* 
         instead of T_*.
6.5.3.2  Added ooaofooa_LOG_bridge.c and ooaofooa_T_bridge.c TODO

6.5.4  Populate (POP) EE
6.5.4.1  The POP EE is used to load model data from a xtUML file into the proper
         in-memory instance data of an application running in Verifier.
6.5.4.2  Added POP EE to the model in the "MC" EE package.
6.5.4.3  Added POP.java to libsrc/ alongside T.java.  Note that POP (EE and 
         .java) only exists in the MC-C branch.  This is key intellectual 
         property that we do not want to make generally available to our
         customers.
6.5.4.4  POP was originally created by a former AE and stored at [5].  However,
         the version of POP in that project did not handle generic packages.
         Since POP.java is now stored in the model compiler branch of bp.core,
         the former project ([5]) is deprecated.  A README is added to the
         project to explain this.  The code in the project is removed to re-
         enforce the fact that it is deprecated.
6.5.4.5  Added support to POP.java to process the data contained in generic
         packages.  As part of the work, internal debug logging was enhanced 
         that provides lots of useful information to BridgePoint developers who
         want to work with POP.  The debug logging is turned off by default, but
         can be turned on with a single flag switch in the debugLog() function.
                  
6.5.5  DocGen updates
6.5.5.1  docgen
         - Added a call to clear the template buffer when the docgen process
         starts.  When running in verifier, this assures the buffer starts empty 
         even if docgen is run several times in a row.
6.5.5.2  docgen_system
         - Updated copyright
         - When selecting the generic packages to process, use R1401 instead of
         R1405.  R1401 returns only the top-level packages directly under the
         system.  The other packages are found via the normal recursive tra-
         versal that finds all the child information.
6.5.5.3  docgen_components
         - Created this new function to factor out a large block of function-
         ality into its own area.  Call this function from 
         docgen_component_packages.
         - TODO - note new GP traversal
6.5.5.4  docgen_interfaces
         - Created this new function to factor out a large block of function-
         ality into its own area.  Call this function from
         docgen_interface_packages.
6.5.5.5  docgen_datatypes
         - Created this new function to factor out a large block of function-
         ality into its own area. Call this function from 
         docgen_datatype_packages.
6.5.5.6  docgen_packages
         - Major overhaul of this function.  Prior to this work, the function
         only looked for children packages and listed them.
         - Now, when docgen is processing a package, it (in order):
           o lists contained types
           o lists contained functions
           o lists contained EEs and their bridges
           o create a subsection for contained classes and recursively traverse 
             down the class' information, displaying it
           o create a subsection for contained components and recursively 
             traverse down each component's information, displaying it
           o create a subsection for contained interfaces and recursively 
             traverse down each interface's information, displaying it
           o create a subsection for contained packages and recursively traverse 
             down the package's information, displaying it
6.5.5.7  docgen_load_project
         - Calls the POP EE to load the model data into the execution instance
         data that is running in verifier.               
6.5.5.8  getContainerListForC_C
         - Added support for finding a component parent who is a generic package
         or another component (via PE_PE)
6.5.5.9  getContainerListForEP_PKG
         - Added support for finding a package parent who is a generic package
         or component
     
6.5.6  Instance Reference Data Types
6.5.6.1  There is a set of inst_ref types for the elements in the metamodel 
         itself.  These are used as parameters to the docgen functions and are
         a key part of the "model-based model compiler" nature of docgen.  These
         types are now stored in their own data type package.  They are non-
         standard in that they do not have graphics like datatypes typically do.
6.5.6.2  When the "Publish References" action is used, inst_ref types are placed
         at the component (domain) level.
                                  
6.5.7  Document generation templates
6.5.7.1  Clean up XML output around figures.  In t.figurebegin.xml, there was an
         opening "<para>" tag.  This tag is not needed and causes an unbalanced 
         paragraph in the XML output when running docgen in verifier.  It does 
         not appear in the generated t.figurebegin.h, meaning someone already 
         found the bug running docgen.exe and fixed the generated code.
6.5.7.2  Hence, the .h versions of the docgen templates are all changed to use 
         the new bridge naming. 
     
6.6  Testing support
6.6.1  Created a sample model [6] to use for manual testing of docgen inside
       Verifier as well as for JUnit testing.
6.6.2  Added JUnit test for this GP only test model.
       
                   
7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
7.1  Other updates
     Added attributes to TE_* and TM_* to support new MC modularization.  
7.1.1  Extended External Entity.  Added attributes: Name, Key_Lett, Descrip
7.1.2  timer.  Added attributes: scope, event_name
7.1.3  Changed conditionality of R2085 between Extended Component and Extended
         External Entity to conditional.  The end result is:
             TE_EE[*] --- R2085 --- [0..1]TE_C
 

8. Unit Test
------------
8.1  Process models that contain generic packages only. Display appropriate HTML
     output.
  _- Create GPS Watch sample model
  _- Create Microwave Oven sample model
  _- Run "Create documentation" on GPS Watch
  _R GPS Watch HTML document pops up with no broken images and valid text
  _- Run "Create documentation" on Microwave Oven
  _R Microwave Oven HTML document pops up with no broken images and valid text
  _- Delete both projects
  
8.2  Process models that contain specific packages only. Display appropriate 
     HTML output. (Manual test)
  _- Create or import a model with only specialized packages.  One of the models
     under <CVS>/Models_SF is probably a good place to look.
  _- Run "Create documentation" on GPS Watch
  _R HTML document pops up with no broken images and valid text
     
8.3  Process models that contain a mixture of generic and specific packages.
     Display appropriate HTML output. (Manual test)
  _- Continue this next test using the model from 8.2
  _- Open it and add a (Generic) Package
  _- In the package add a component
  _- Add some data inside the component
  _- Run "Create documentation" on the model
  _R HTML document pops up with no broken images and valid text
