BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Dialog text is not provided to the user during CLI

1. Abstract
-----------
When the Bridgepoint Command Line Interface (CLI) is used dialogs are 
suppressed and the user does not see error/information because of this.

2. History
----------

3. Document References

4. Background
-------------
During CLI use, dialogs are suppressed (as they must be).  However, the user 
must be able to see the text.  This is especially true in the case of errors.  
This issue is raised to make the information from a dialog go to stdout.

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1 When running from the CLI, text from dialogs should be sent to the console.

6. Work Required
----------------
There are 4 spots in UIUtil.java where the tool checks a static variable,
IsRunningHeadless, to see if the tool is running headless (from the CLI).  
If running headless we do not display dialogs.  The problem the is that 
the tool also doesn't currently output any text to the console at these 
places which means the user is not informed of these errors.   

6.1 UIUtil::outputTextForHeadlessRun(BPMessageTypes type, 
    String title, String text, String value) shall be introduced.  When 
    running headless this is called to write dialog type, title, text, and 
    where applicable default return value to std::out by calling 
    CorePlugin.out.println(outputString).    
6.1.1 UIUtil::outputTextForHeadlessRun() shall get called in each of the 
    places where the tool checks the IsRunningHeadless variable to see if a
    dialog should be displayed or not.  

7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
7.1 While testing the change called out above, a couple of places were found 
    that were still displaying dialogs without going through UIUtil.  
    These were modified to go through UIUtil.



8. Unit Test
------------
_- create a test workspace that contains MicrowaveOven from the Quick Start
_- Open a shell
_- cd <BP install>/eclipse
_- Modify BridgePoint_CLI.bat to assure no license is available
_- Assure that the WORKSPACE variable in the batch file points to your 
   workspace.
_- ./BridgePoint_CLI.bat Build -project MicrowaveOven
_R License error information is displayed on the console
