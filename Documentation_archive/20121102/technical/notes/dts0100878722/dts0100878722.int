BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Marked #include not Included
Returning Cardinality Fails
User Changeable main()

1. Abstract

This note documents small MC bug fixes.

[1] ClearQuest dts0100878722 - Marked types do not #include marked file
[2] ClearQuest dts0100840877 - 
"return cardinality" causes incorrect Escher_ClearSet in generated C code
[3] ClearQuest dts0100879135 - Provide marking to set "main"
[4] Help > Help Contents > MC-3020 Users Guide

4. Background
-------------
878722 was reported by a customer who used MarkDataTypeAsPointer.  The type
is marked as a pointer, but the marked include file is not #include'd.

840877 reports a legitimate error when returning (using the return statement)
the cardinality of an instance set.  The instance set is actually cleared
before the return statement occurs.  This clearing is part of the proper
execution of the activity body deallocating temporary container sets before
leaving the context.  However, this clearing is interfering with the counting
of the instances in the cardinality operation.

879135 asks for a way to set the name of "main" in the generated sys_main
file.  This was possible in the past by following instructions in the Users
Guide to use sys_functions.arc.  These instructions have been removed, but
they said something like:
  _- Build Project
  _- Copy /gen/code_generation/sys_functions.arc to /gen.
  _- Edit GetMainTaskEntryDeclaration function to taste.
  R- Get updated main declaration.

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1.  Include the supplied include file when a data type is marked as a
      an implementation pointer.
5.2.  Provide a means to return the cardinality value while continuing to
      properly deallocate instances in activity bodies.
5.3.  Provide a means to change the name of the main entry point.

6. Work Required
----------------
6.1   Add a method that queries TE_DTs for any that have been given an
      include file name.
6.2   Change the return statement generated code to use a local variable to
      hold the value of the cardinality operation while instance sets are
      being deallocated.  Then, we will return the temporary local variable
      value.
6.2   A way exists, but it will be cleaner to add a new one.  Add an
      attribute to TE_TARGET called "main".  By default, assign it to "main".
      Use this in the existing sys_functions.arc.

7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
7.1  nothing to comment
7.2  Here I found that a lot of effort/code that was in place to avoid a
     C compiler warning for coercion of real to integer had a small bug that
     prevented it from working at all.  It was a variable naming issue.

8. Unit Test
------------
8.1  Run the customer-supplied test case.
8.2  Run the customer-supplied test case.
8.3  Run any model and supply this line in system.mark:
     .assign te_target.main = "my_main"
     See that the resulting main in sys_main.c is my_main.
