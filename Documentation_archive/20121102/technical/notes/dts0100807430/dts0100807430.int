BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Repair signal parameter computation

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the change needed to repair a defect where parameters to
signals were not being computed before the signal was being sent.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] ClearQuest DEI dts0100807430 - Verifier execution errors on UDT
    communication between components.

4. Background
-------------
When sending literal and pre-computed values as arguments, Verifier behaves
correctly. However, if an inline call is made to compute a value, Verifier
enqueues the message before the necessary values have been created.

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1 All arguments to signals must be fully computed before the signal is
    sent.

6. Work Required
----------------
6.1 As described in the issue notes, in Signal Invocation.execute() the logic
block which handles signal events needs to be modified thus:

Change 'discard' to 'complete' and replace the following two statements with:

    if complete
      relate localEngine to pendingEvt across R2976;
      pendingEvt.fire();
    else
      // Value computation is incomplete, exit and allow computation of event
      // arguments to complete. Dispose this event instance,
      // another will be created on re-entry above.
      pendingEvt.dispose();
    end if;

The comment was added to clarify the reason for the added logic.

7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

8. Unit Test
------------
The fix is confirmed manually against the model attached to the issue. However,
the model is rather large to be used for a unit test. Accordingly, a new model,
dts0100807430, is created and added to the BridgePoint Models test project. The
model consists of two components, a sender and a receiver. They are wired across
a simple interface that offers one signal that takes two integer arguments. The
sender sends two signals, the first sends a literal value and a value in a
temporary variable. The second sends a literal value and supplies the second
value by means of a function returning a value. Prior to this work, the first
signal works but the second does not, with several instances of the Verifer
suspending due to internal errors.

Running this model is added to the Verifier JUnit test.

_- Set a breakpoint in the entry action of the state machine receiving the
   signal.
_- Execute the startTest function.
_R The breakpoint is hit
_R The literalValue and computed values are shown in the variables window as
   '2' and '5' respectively.
_- Resume.
_R 'Test passed.' is shown in the console.
_R The breakpoint is hit again.
_R The literalValue and computed values are shown in the variables window as
   '2' and '5' respectively.
_- Resume.
_R 'Test passed.' is shown in the console.
_R The Verifier session is quiescent and can be terminated.
