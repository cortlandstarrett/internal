7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7.1 Resolve pasteFunction issue

An issue was found while onsite with a customer.  The Function
Package.pasteFunction() operation was not correctly hooking the pasted function
up with the destination domain (if present).  This is resolved by this work.

7.2 Prevent rename which would result in overwriting existing folder

In section 7.5 of [2] we attempted to merge folder contents.  SVN still
considered merged files as marked for deletion.  This is harder to get around in
SVN, as the restore action will replace the files with a possibly incorrect
version of the files.  The merge code has been removed and in place we prevent
the rename and display a dialog explaining why the rename was not allowed.

7.3 Testing problems with model root deletion

Testing showed that removal of a model root from the model root map can occur
before later elements are fully removed.  This resulted in the model root being
recreated, which led to left over instances that were not consistent with the
removed model root.

To address this the listener that previously removed model roots is changed from
a ModelChangeListener to a TransactionListener.  This still leaves cases where
the model root can be deleted before processing other deletion data.  One case
is with graphical editor transaction listeners, these are added when an editor
is opened which is after the model root transaction listener has been added.  To
address this support is added to allowing firing transaction events to a new
list of transaction listeners.  This list is of transaction listeners that shall
be notified last or after all other transaction listeners. 

7.4 Always delete model root as last event

Now that model roots are being disposed of properly we must guarantee that it is
the last operation.  During testing it was noticed that batched model change
notification was occurring after the model roots had been disposed of.  The
transaction listeners that have been registered to run at the end of
notification are now called after the batch notifications. 

7.5 Dispose of all model roots under a system

During testing it was noticed that a resource deletion of the system model xtuml
file was removing the components, but not all model roots underneath.  Logic is
added that removes all model roots found under the system.
