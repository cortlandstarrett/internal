BridgePoint Technical Note
HOWTO Update the BridgePoint Version Number


Abstract
--------
This note describes the steps to be performed in order to update or "bump"
the version number of BridgePoint.

History
-------
None.

Document References
-------------------
[1] Issue 3203. http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3203

Background
----------
It is the policy of the BridgePoint development team to update the version
number of BridgePoint with each external delivery of the code.  This mostly
involves updating the plugin version numbers.

Intended Audience
-----------------
This document is intended for the BridgePoint development team.

Steps
-----
x- Update your development workspace with the latest version from HEAD of
   all plugin projects, be sure to include the "model_compilers" project, the 
   "Installer_MIP_MIMIC" project, and "mc"
x- Check out/update bp.internal.tools (if it is not already present in your 
   workspace)
x- Edit bp.internal.tools/update_BP_version.xml to contain the new version and
   commit this to the issue used for the version  bump.
x- right-click, "Run As > Ant Build"


x- Go to the bp.doc plugin and search under that plugin for the old version 
   number(example: 1.5.1)
xR Several html files are found
x- Copy the new version (ex 1.5.2)  to the Windows Clipboard
x- Work through the Search view in Eclipse and for each match found open the 
   file in MS Word and update the version using MS Word.
       IMPORTANT: Do not update any HTML file versions inside eclipse.  Navigate
                  to the file on disk and edit the file with MS Word.
xR Version update is now complete, all files that must be modified are now
   "dirty" in your workspace.   
x- Compare the locally changed projects with HEAD.  Use the code change scraper
   to get the list of changed files.  Commit the list to the issue for this
   work.
