$Log: Unit_test_checklist.chk,v $
Revision 1.4  2012/06/15 23:50:16  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Removed several tests from Core Suite II that were failing because they require the ability to create specialized packages to pass.   I was able to simple remove these tests because they each had an analogous GenericPackage test already created.

Revision 1.3  2012/06/15 21:51:42  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Simply removed the test, testNoBadDomainFileAfterEditingFormalizedDomain, because it relies on creating artifacts that can  no longer be created, so  this behavior is obsolete.

Revision 1.2  2012/06/15 21:41:56  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Removed test generation of S_DPK in the generic package action tests.

Revision 1.1  2012/06/13 15:51:13  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Updated results

Revision 1.7  2012/06/12 11:45:32  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Updated test results

Revision 1.6  2012/06/07 20:11:22  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Removed nature tests that were testing creation of specialized packages at the system level.  Note that these test were only exercising package creation, not creating elements within those packages so removing these does not decrease test coverage.  Here is the list of tests removed:
testCreateActivityInSystem
testCreateCommunicationInSystem
testCreateComponentPackageInSystem
testCreateDataTypePackageInSystem
testCreateInterfacePackageInSystem
testCreateSequenceInSystem

Revision 1.5  2012/06/07 19:08:36  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Removed several tests that require creation of specialized packages.  These tests all have corresponding 'GenericPackage' versions, so removing them does not cause less test coverage.   I also updated test results to account  for the fact that this removal of tests caused differences with the expected results (because some model elements are no longer being created).   With this, all of mdl tests are passing so I also updated the test results accordingly.

Revision 1.4  2012/06/05 14:40:35  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Updated expected results for testExportOdmsWithGraphics because with the removal of SPs the operation log changed to no longer include as many calls through SystemModel::ActoinFilter since there are no longer as many elements in test model.  The reason there are not as many elements is that the nested specialized packages tests were removed because they no longer are valid.

Revision 1.3  2012/06/05 14:01:53  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Removed IOMdlNestedTest.  This test is obsolete because it only tests nested packages which have now been deprecated AND a new test has been created for packages, IOMdlNestedTestGenerics.

Revision 1.2  2012/05/30 19:21:16  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Updated  test results

Revision 1.1  2012/05/30 17:24:01  rmulvey
job:dts0100889208
Introduced test results

Revision 1.8  2012/04/18 20:03:15  tlondon
Job: dts0100836674

Include new launch configs

Revision 1.7  2012/03/18 23:59:08  rmulvey
job:dts0100732443 dts0100853458
Updated the test checklist to reflect the fact that there should be no test failures in what we are running.

Revision 1.6  2012/03/07 14:31:31  rmulvey
job:dts0100852140
Promoted changes from the Documentation folder to head.  A new test suite was introduced (System Level TestsGenerics).

Job: dts0100852140
Add new test suite.

Revision 1.1  2012/01/11 21:10:21  rmulvey

Introduced

Revision 1.2  2011/12/15 04:15:49  rmulvey
job:dts0100779182
Updated test results and the test result checklist

Revision 1.1  2011/10/04 18:23:20  hkhaled
job:dts0100654681
