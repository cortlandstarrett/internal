* Notes:
--------

Some tests have been removed to allow the tests to complete without
any failures.  The comments below describe the tests that have been
removed.
 
1) MC-3020 Test problem (dts0100656063)

2) Verifier Test problems (dts0100656068)
   CDM > These are understood, benign failures except the last one (tree
   selection issue) which is unknown to me. Failure to select can indicate real
   problems with the tree. If it can be shown that this too is benign, fixing
   these tests can be de-prioritized and left till last.

   SKB > Recently (as of 11/2010) we've started seeing some more tests fail 
   consistently.  A few have been commented out, but a few have not.  The ones
   left it will pass sometimes, fail others.  They are:
     testExecuteClassBasedOperationOAL
     testExecuteClassBasedOperationNoOAL
     testExecuteClassBasedOperationWithParameters
     testTerminateAndRelaunch
     testISMTransitionAction
     testVerifierCreationTransitionBP

3) bp.als.oal.test problem (dts0100656058 and dts0100584445)

4) ui.properties.test problems (dts0100656086)
   
   The following tests were failing (sometimes).  So, 
   bp.ui.properties.test/arc/create_view_test.arc was modified to remove them.
   To see the change look for the block marked with the comment:
   .// START: dts0100656086  
   .// END: dts0100656086  

5) bp.core.test 
   RTOMove test problems (dts0100656045)

6) Compare Test problems (bp.compare.test) (dts0100656072)
6.1) 2 test failures in bp.compare.test.HierarchyFileCoverageTest:
    testPEIFileCoverage
    testAttributeCoverageinPEI
    These fail because the expected result contains the new 
    PackabeableElement_c, but the actual result does not.  This problem
    started with the introduction of this element (dts0100631941).  I tried
    adding a EP_PKG with an element in it (an Actor) thinking it would fix it, 
    but it did not.

7) Core Suite II problems (dts0100656069)
7.1) 6 CommunicationLink tests are failing because in 
      testFormalizeLinkWithSupertypeSubtype.  The formalize wizard  is
      not popping-up as it should.  This is a test-only problem 
     (verified by manual testing).  Note that tests in this suite
      are dependent on each other, so as soon as one fails so do the others.
      testFormalizeLinkWithSupertypeSubtype
      testFormalizeLinkWithSimpleAssociation
      testFormalizeLinkWithReflexiveAssociation
	  testFormalizeLinkWithReflexiveLinkedAssociation
      testToggleLinkVisibility
      CDM > Likely a race condition and probably quite easy to pin down. 1 MD.

8) io.mdl.test - PKGCM Test Suite Problems (dts0100656080)
8.1) Problems introduced with Eclipse 3.4.2 that are caused by the new 
      LTKLauncher stuff in eclipse's DeleteResourceAction. We're not seeing 
      the deletion job come through, so the Canvas for an open System Model 
      isn't closed when the project is deleted.

      bp/io/mdl/test/pkgcm/PkgCMDeleteTest.java::testDeleteSystem_ThruME_DescriptionFocused()
      CDM > Insufficient data to comment.
      
8.2) Errors introduced during dts0100631941 (package  un-specialization)   
      bp/io/mdl/test/pkgcm/PkgCMRenameTest.java::testRenameModelClass_ThruRN_CanvasFocused()
      bp/io/mdl/test/pkgcm/PkgCMRenameTest.java::testRenameModelClass_ThruRN_DescFocused()

9) ui.canvas.test - Canvas Test Suite (dts0100656082)
  
10) Core workspace setup and existing projects (dts0100703162)
    The core nature tests need to be rewritten to account for generic package 
    functionality  
    
11) These tests will fail until dts0100774464 is resolved.  Somewhere around
    237 failures and 10 errors are expected.

12) The are two failures in the Existing Project Test Suite : 
    testDataTypeAssignmentInterfaceOperationInDifferentPackageRoot
    testDataTypeAssignmentPropertyParameterInDifferentPackageRoot
    They were in head when 779182 was promoted. Debugging them was not straight 
    forward and it is decided to push the issue into Head for now 
    and fix the failures later.

13) Failures in this suite were introduced in the BP 3.4.0 release.  They were
    investigated at that time and we decided to allow them.

14) Log file entry

15) Result comparison failures, probably benign.

16) Some comparison failures, a suspicious Undo test failure, one null result,
    one assertion failure.

17) Multiple 'Process was not suspended' errors most likely would pass on rerun.
    One result comparison failure, elements are being started in a different
    order, probably benign.
    One NPE during resume, a possible problem.

18) Multiple null results, one result comparison error.

19) Log file empty, 2 rename failures

20) Array out of Bounds error

21) I saw all tests pass, but never all in the same run.
