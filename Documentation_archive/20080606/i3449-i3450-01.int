BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Relax Same Data Rule in MCs and Fix Typo

1. Abstract
-----------
Relaxing the "Same Data" rule in BridgePoint impacts the model compilers
in precisely the same way as it impacts Verifier.  Make the same set of
changes to MC-3020 to traverse R532.

2. History
----------

3. Document References

[4] Analysis Note:  Relax Same Data Rule
    <cvs>/notes/i3208.ant

4. Background
-------------
The model compilers run from much of the same meta-model that the Verifier
does.  As the meta-model changes, traversals through the meta-model must
change.  A section of meta-model around event data changed recently (to be
more consistent with other parameter data).
See [3] and the Analysis Section of [4] for more background.

5. Design
---------
The work required is driven precisely by the Analysis section of [4].

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
While implementing the changes for relaxing the same data rule, I ran into
a typo in the q.domain.init_object.arc file.  It turns out there was an
issue already open for it, [1].  I fixed it.  It was a 2 character name 
change.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1.    Run existing tests.

8. Code Changes
---------------
8.1.    The work was performed directly in HEAD.
8.2.    The following archetype files were changed.
8.2.1.  model_compilers/mc3020/arc/bridge.arc
8.2.2.  model_compilers/mc3020/arc/clr_bridge.arc
