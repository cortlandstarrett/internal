BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Upgrade BridgePoint/EDGE projects to BridgePoint/CDT projects


1. Abstract
-----------
The CDT perspective provides a tool on the context menu of a project: 
"New > Convert to a C/C++ Project".  This is used to add the CDT natures and 
builders to an existing project.  This tool is useful but insufficient for a
complete migration from EDGE to CDT on existing projects.

2. History
----------
None.

[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100803782 - Remove automated CDT conversion check

4. Background
-------------
In BridgePoint 3.4.0 we are migrating from EDGE to CDT for the underlying code
compilation system.  We need to convert existing BridgePoint projects from EDGE
to CDT.  CDT helps us, but doesn't do a complete job for all of our needs.

5. Design
---------
5.1  Functionality
       The model compiler plugin is enhanced to provide the extended conversion
       we want to perform.
5.1.1  The workspace projects are iterated over. If xtUML projects are found 
       that have the EDGE nature, the user is notified that the conversion needs
       to be performed via a query dialog:
           Your workspace contains xtUML projects that need to be updated.  
           BridgePoint requires support for the Eclipse C/C++ development 
           toolkit (CDT) be added to each xtUML project.  Code compilation 
           will not work until this update is performed.
           
           Do you wish to perform this update now?
                                             Yes      No
       A "No" answer will abort the conversion process.  A "Yes" answer will 
       continue the process.
5.1.2  For each xtUML Project that has the EDGE nature we perform the following
       steps:
         - Remove the EDGE nature
         - Remove the EDGE builder
         - Add CDT support.  This is done by effectively running the same 
           functionality provided by the "Convert to a C/C++ Project" action.
         - Move the CDT Builder to run last
         - Move the Scanner Configuration Builder to run last
         - Remove the .xpj file (EDGE project file)
         - Remove the "Configuration 0/" folder (EDGE build folder)
         
5.2  Entry points
       There are two entry points into the CDT conversion functionality this 
       enhancement provides.
5.2.1  The model compiler plugin is modified to check each xtUML Project in the
       workspace on startup.
5.2.2  A entry is available in the Model Explorer context menu under 
       "BridgePoint Utilities > Enable xtUML Projects for CDT".  Invoking this
       action runs the same check that is performed at startup.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1  The MC3020Nature class provides a number of static functions that are used
     to perform various configuration type actions on our xtUML Projects.  
     Several of the functions were enhanced in this work to make them more 
     generic so they can be used for builders other than the Pre-builder and 
     MC-3020 builder.
     
6.2  We do not want to leave this automatic project iteration/check at BP 
     start-up for ever.  It just becomes a performance drain.  Issue [2] is 
     opened to revisit this feature and to disable it in a later release.

6.3  Along the lines of 6.2, we have decided to disable the pre-builder check.  
     This feature has been around for over a year.  Since there may be cases
     where we still want access to the feature, a menu item is added to the
     "BridgePoint Utilities" context menu: "Verify Projects Use Pre-builder".
     The functionality is shipped disabled by commenting out the action 
     extension point in bp.utilities/plugin.xml.  However, still being left in
     place it can be enabled and used in the field as needed.

6.4  Update core.test for the workspace setup for generics test to run the CDT
     project conversion after all other tests are run.  This will prevent the
     popup dialog about needing to convert to CDT projects when we run the 
     existing projects for generics test.

6.5  Launch configs are updated to include CDT plugins since the CDT project 
     upgrade checker now requires CDT support.
     
7. Unit Test
------------
EDGE zipfile projects in \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\test_data\dts0100795435\
EDGE sample projects in <BP_SVN>/trunk/AE/SKB/Models/Test

7.1 Existing JUnits must pass

Right now, the following tests are manual

7.2 Test 1
_- import a zipfile edge project
_- run xtUML CDT convert action
_R .xpj and Configuration 0/ are deleted
_R .cproject is added
_- build the project
_R an EXE is built
_- delete the project
  
7.3 Test 2
_- check out an CM'd edge project  
_- run xtUML CDT convert action
_R .xpj and Configuration 0/ are deleted
_R .cproject is added
_- build the project
_R an EXE is built
_- delete the project

7.4 Test 3
_- import a zipfile edge project
_- restart BP
_R see notification on startup about need for CDT conversion
_- run xtUML CDT convert action
_R .xpj and Configuration 0/ are deleted
_R .cproject is added
_- build the project
_R an EXE is built
_- delete the project

7.5 Test 4  
_- create a new xtUML project
_- add a domain
_- open .project
_- remove pre-builder (the build command section for exportbuilder)
_- Open the context menu in ME and expand BridgePoint Utilities
_R The "Verify projects for pre-builder" action is not present
_- exit BP
_- modify bp.utilities/plugin.xml to uncomment the verify for pre-builder action
_- start BP
_- no notification on startup
_- run add pre-builder action
_- build the project
_- an EXE is built
_- delete the project
_- exit BP
_- modify bp.utilities/plugin.xml to comment the verify for pre-builder action,
     we want to commit the file with the action commented out/disabled

7.6 Test 5
_- Check out both SVN EDGE projects
_- run xtUML CDT convert action
_R .xpj and Configuration 0/ are deleted in both projects
_R .cproject is added in both projects
_- build the projects
_R an EXE is built for each
