BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Include meta-model, in model form, in the distribution


1. Abstract
-----------
The BridgePoint team has decided to start shipping a graphical version of the
xtUML Metamodel ("OOA of OOA") with the tool.  This note describes the changes
to support shipping this model.

2. History
----------
None.

4. Background
-------------
We have long shipped a raw version of the OOA of OOA in SQL format for model
compiler writers to use.  Customers have asked for a graphical version of the
metamodel that will be easier to comprehend and browse.

5. Design
---------
5.1  Updated the welcome page graphics
5.1.1  The welcome page graphics used a background of intermixed gears that is a
       legacy from our EDGE-branding days.
5.1.2  The EDGE-style background is removed in favor of the gradient white style
       background with blue and orange buttons that follows the style cues used 
       on the www.mentor.com webpage and the VSI welcome page.

5.2  Add link to create the metamodel on the Welcome > Quick Start page.
5.2.1  The link will read:
        Documentation Project - xtUML Metamodel
        Click here to create a project that includes a copy of the xtUML 
        metamodel.
5.2.2  The link will run an action class defined in the bp.welcome plugin named
       SingleFileModelGettingStartedAction.
5.2.2.1  This action class takes a project name.  A project with the given name
         is created if it does not already exist.  If it does exist, the user
         is notified and queried if they want to delete the existing project
         before proceeding.  Answering "Yes" will delete the project and create 
         a new one.  Answering "No" will abort the documentation model
         creation process.
5.2.2.2  Once the new project is created, a single-file model with the given 
         project name is imported from the bp.welcome/models folder in the 
         plugin.
5.2.2.3  Presently, the created project has no builders associated with it.  An
         issue is raised [3] to add enhancements to enable this class to create
         projects with CDT support.
         
5.3  Several bits of functionality related to creating and deleting projects,
     importing models, etc. is refactored from bp.test.TestingUtilities to
     bp.utilities.ProjectUtilities where it can be used in the shipped plugin
     set.
5.3.1  There are additional opportunities for cleanup and refactoring in this
       area.  However, owing to time constraints and the non-critical nature
       of the changes, this work was not taken as far as it could go.  Follow-on
       work is in [2].
     
5.4  The metamodel model
5.4.1  The metamodel model is stored as a single-file model in the welcome
       plugin under the models/ folder.  The model is stored in single-file 
       form and not as a multi-file model because the golden copy of model-
       compiler metamodel is in a branch of bp.core.  This golden copy is ex-
       ported, modified and shipped.  This keeps us from having to maintain two
       synchronized models in two different places.
5.4.2  A file named README.txt is put into the welcome plugin that outlines how
       the metamodel model file is to be created:
       
HOWTO Update the Metamodel model
--------------------------------
- export bp.core [MC-A] to single file model mm_first.xtuml with "Export OAL" 
    preference turned off, and "Export Graphics" preference turned on
- import mm_first.xtuml into a new project in a sandbox workspace
- From the xtUML Modeling Perspective, edit the model to remove 
  - Document Data Types DT
  - DocGen FN
  - MCfunctions FN
  - All of the EEs under External Entities EE
  - MC EE
  - Breakpoint SS
  - Document SS
- export the modified model to single file model xtUML_Metamodel.xtuml with 
    "Export OAL" preference turned off, and "Export Graphics" preference turned 
    on
- copy xtUML_Metamodel.xtuml to com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome/models/xtUML_Metamodel.xtuml

      The model is modified by hand and not via the 
      xtumlmc_cleanse_for_BridgePoint function in xtumlmc_build because the 
      script can't remove the graphics for only certain subsystems.  Thus, if
      we used the script we would be left with a lot of unwanted graphics
      data in our single-file model.
 
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  A new set of JUnit tests is added to the bp.welcome test to exercise
     creating the xtUML metamodel project when it already exists and when it
     does not.
