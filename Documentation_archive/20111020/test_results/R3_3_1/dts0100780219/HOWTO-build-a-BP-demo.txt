[1] CQ issue dts0100590737
    Provide a licensing solution for the 2009 ET-robocon educational challenge
    Note: This was the issue where we introduced a way to provide a demo 
    version of BP.  The development notes describe the options we examined
    and why we selected the method we did.

How to create a BP demo
-----------------------
11:00
x- Determine the demo period.  You will need to know the start date and the end
   date.
   20110627-20110930
     
x- Create a issue in ClearQuest to track the request for a new demo.   
   For an example see dts0100685202.
   dts0100780219

11:15   
_- Build the source with the demo license check enabled   
	x- Open a standard BridgePoint development workspace based on the head 
	   branch.
11:15	
	x- Get the appropriate version of the source for the demo.  Use a 
	   release tag to check out the appropriate version if needed.
	   R3_3_1
11:35	 
	_- Branch the plugins that will be modified.  NOTE!!  These changes will 
	   NOT be promoted to head.	  
11:35	   
		x- Create a branch (example R131Demo) for the 
		   following projects:
		   Note: The changes made here will NOT be promoted to head.
		   WARNING!!:  Keep the name of the branch short.  A branch build will be 
		               utilized and a long name causes the GettingStarted demo
		               ISM files not to be copied (255 character limit).
		   model_compilers 
		   com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core
	
	       Note: If creating this demo based on a recent release, then ALL 
	             plugins must be included in the branch.  For example, if
	             you used the R3_1_0 tag to get all the plugin in the 
	             previous step, then you should branch all plugins at this
	             time. 
12:15	             
	_- Enable the demo license check in bp.core	
		_- "Uncomment" the java code in 
		   bp/core/util/BridgePointLicenseManager.java::isDemoLicensed()
		   that turns on the demo license
		_- Check in the change to the branch
12:25	
	_- Update the BridgePoint version number as described in [3]
2:30	
	x- Build the workspace

	_R The workspace builds successfully
3:01
         
_- Create a new demo key file
	x- Checkout the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator from HEAD in the BridgePoint CVS 
	   repository.
	x- Open the Java perspective   
	x- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and build it 
	  (Project > Build Project)
	xR BridgePointDemoKeyCreator builds with no errors
	x- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and run it 
	   (right click > Run As... > Java Application)
	x- Enter the demo start date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	x- Enter the demo end date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	xR The demo file, BridgePointDemo.txt, is create in the folder that the 
	   MGLS_LICENSE_FILE environment variable points to.
	x- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt created in the previous step to:
	   <workspace>/BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate>
	   where startdate is the YYYYMMDD for the demo start and enddate is 
	   YYYYMMDD for the end of the  demo.
	x- Check in the demo file to the CVS repository
3:06

_- Modify gen_erate.exe to allow the binary model compiler to run during the 
   demo period.	
	_- Modify model_compilers/generator/gen_erate/bp_source/win32/7.1B/main/src/gen_erate/main_gen_erate.cc
	   and put in the hard-coded date-check.  To see what this code looks like 
	   compare revisions 1.55.2.3 and 1.55 of main_gen_erate.cc.
	   Note that this change simply wraps the binary 3020 license in a 
	   try/catch block that allows the binary license to work for the specified 
	   (hardcoded) demo period.
	_- Note!!  Make sure you change the 2 hard-coded dates in the above code to
	   reflect the correct demo start and end dates.
	_- check in the change to the branch
	_- Build a new gen_erate.exe
3:30
	
x- Copy the gen_erate.exe to the tucson server so the build can include it.	
	x- Use ftp to copy the new gen_erate.exe to your home directory on the
	   tucson.wv.mentorg.com server
	x- Log in to tucson.wv.mentorg.com using putty, or some other terminal
	x- Copy the new gen_erate.exe into the folder where all copies
	   of generator ever used are stored.
	       Note: In the following command replace <branch name>
	             with the branch being used.  
	             For example: R326Demo	             
		_- cp ~/gen_erate.exe /arch1/products/tiger/extra_files_for_build/old_files/gen_erate.exe-<branch name>
		_- cd /arch1/products/tiger/extra_files_for_build
		_- mv ./gen_erate.exe old_files/gen_erate.exe-tempForDemoBuild
		_- cp old_files/gen_erate.exe-R326Demo ./gen_erate.exe
	    
	    NOTE: Later in this procedure, after the build is done, we 
	          will return to this location on tucson.wv.mentorg.com,
	          and restore  old_files/gen_erate.exe-tempForDemoBuild
3:37	          
_- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt file into place so it can be include in the 
   build of the installer.
	x- Use ftp to copy 
	   <workspace>BridgePointDemoKeyCreator\license_files_handed_out\BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> 
	   that was created in prior steps to your home directory on the 
	   tucson.wv.mentorg.com server
	x- Use Remote desktop to log in to the build server (svr-azt-eng-01)
	x- On the build server (svr-azt-eng-01), use ftp to copy 
	   BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> into the following 
	   folder: 
	   C:\BridgePoint_e3.5\BridgePointDeliverables\license
	x- On the build server (svr-azt-eng-01), open windows explorer, and
	   navigate to C:\BridgePoint_e3.5\BridgePointDeliverables\license
	x- rename BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> to
	   BridgePointDemo.txt
x- Launch the branch build on the build server.
xR Build is successful
6:30
_- Restore gen_erate.exe on tucson
	_- Log in to tucson.wv.mentorg.com using putty, or some other terminal
	_- Restore the backed-up gen_erate.exe 
		_- cd /arch1/products/tiger/extra_files_for_build
		_- rm ./gen_erate.exe
		_- mv old_files/gen_erate.exe-tempForDemoBuild ./gen_erate.exe
_- Remove BridgePointDemo.txt from the installer file folder
	_- On the build server (svr-azt-eng-01), open windows explorer, and
	   navigate to C:\BridgePoint_e3.5\BridgePointDeliverables\license
	_- delete BridgePointDemo.txt
_R The build portion of this procedure is complete.  What follows is the test 
   of the demo installer.
6:40

x- Test the installer
   _- If any MGLS* or LM* environment variable exit in the test environment
      comment them out (simply rename them by adding "noForDemo" to their name). 
   _- Install BridgePoint 
   _- Launch the tool
   _R No license errors
   _- Open Help > License Information...
   _- It show  no licenses are present (this is normal for the demo version).
   _- Use the Getting started demo to create MicrowaveOven
   _- Build MicrowaveOven with MC3020
   _R No errors
   _- Launch verifier and run MicrowaveOven
   _R No Errors
   _- Change the system date to 1 day after expiration
   _R License errors appear
   _- Restore the system date and any environment variable that were 
      commented-out in the first step.
   _- FYI (for internal testing), note that after hitting a license error with 
      the demo version the tool will continue to fail (with license errors) 
      until a new, clean, valid,copy of BridgePointDemo.txt is put into the 
      license folder.
6:55   
x- Archive the installer
  _- Open the location \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\engineering releases
  _- Create a subdir with the release number and purpose
  _- Copy the installer into this directory
