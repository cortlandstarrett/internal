This document captures the state of the BridgePoint unit tests ran against the
Review-i3640 branch.  Note that I made quite a few changes in the promotion 
workspace to the ecore import/export to account for issues I found while 
testing with BP models.  I also added changes called out by i3679.

* Notes:
--------
1) Results log not written, see issue 3280
2) ...bp.io.mdl.test.pkgcm.restore.PkgCMRestoreTestSuite    Broken, untestable
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc2020.test			            Broken, untestable
4) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.test			            Broken, untestable
5) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6 expected errors:
	The i3099 implementation note contins this info:
		The following tests are expected to fail until the next chunk of
		verifier work is complete:
			testExecuteClassBasedOperationWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalNotAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteInterfaceOperationWithParameters

		These 2 are races conditions, so they may sometimes pass:
			testInterfaceExecutionSignalNotAssignedCurrentExecutingAction
			testInterfaceExecutionOperationCurrentExecutingAction

6) Core Suite II											10 expected errors
    Currently there are 4 tests that are failing due to location differences
    in the draw logs.  The tests are:
        testCreateInformalSequenceUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalCommunicationUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalUseCaseUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalActivityUnderComponent()

    There are also 6 failures due to canvas draw logs not reflecting what is on
    the canvas (Bug 3522 opened for these):
        testFormalizeMessageWithBridgeOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithFunction()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedEvent()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedEvent()

7) IO MDL Test Suite	2 expected failures
    
    Note: This was "8 errors caused by a log file being present".  With a note
          that they would be resolved by issue 3491.  It is now
          down to 2 errors. They are not log file errors, but they were
          part of the earlier 8 failures.
          
8) [5/9/2008 1:57:26 PM] Travis London says: I am going to pass on 3490 for
   promotion, but there are some timing related test failures in io.mdl PKG
   CM Test suite (big suprise).  When I do the next bit of work I will work
   these timing failures out.  Of course the promoter may or may not see them.

9) Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
