* Notes:
--------
1) Results log not written, see issue 3280
2) ...bp.io.mdl.test.pkgcm.restore.PkgCMRestoreTestSuite    Broken, untestable
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc2020.test			            Broken, untestable
4) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.test			            Broken, untestable
5) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  5.1) Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  5.2) Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  5.3) Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)

6) Core Suite II											10 expected errors
    Currently there are 4 tests that are failing due to location differences
    in the draw logs.  The tests are:
        testCreateInformalSequenceUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalCommunicationUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalUseCaseUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalActivityUnderComponent()

    There are also 6 failures due to canvas draw logs not reflecting what is on
    the canvas (Bug 3522 opened for these):
        testFormalizeMessageWithBridgeOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithFunction()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedEvent()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedEvent()

7) IO MDL Test Suite	2 expected failures

    Note: This was "8 errors caused by a log file being present".  With a note
          that they would be resolved by issue 3491.  It is now
          down to 2 errors. They are not log file errors, but they were
          part of the earlier 8 failures.

8) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
