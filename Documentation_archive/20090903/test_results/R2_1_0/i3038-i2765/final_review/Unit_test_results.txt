* Notes:
--------
1) Results log not written, see issue 3280
2) ...bp.io.mdl.test.pkgcm.restore.PkgCMRestoreTestSuite    Broken, untestable
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc2020.test			            Broken, untestable
4) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.test			            Broken, untestable
5) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6 expected errors:
	The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the 
	next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.  
	There are 2 kinds of failures:
	5.1) Comparison failur: Default parameter was not as expected...
	5.2) Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
	     Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
	     items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
	     race conditions.	  

6) Core Suite II											10 expected errors
    Currently there are 4 tests that are failing due to location differences
    in the draw logs.  The tests are:
        testCreateInformalSequenceUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalCommunicationUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalUseCaseUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalActivityUnderComponent()

    There are also 6 failures due to canvas draw logs not reflecting what is on
    the canvas (Bug 3522 opened for these):
        testFormalizeMessageWithBridgeOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithFunction()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedEvent()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedEvent()

7) IO MDL Test Suite	2 expected failures
    
    Note: This was "8 errors caused by a log file being present".  With a note
          that they would be resolved by issue 3491.  It is now
          down to 2 errors. They are not log file errors, but they were
          part of the earlier 8 failures.
          
8) [5/9/2008 1:57:26 PM] Travis London says: I am going to pass on 3490 for
   promotion, but there are some timing related test failures in io.mdl PKG
   CM Test suite (big suprise).  When I do the next bit of work I will work
   these timing failures out.  Of course the promoter may or may not see them.

9) Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
