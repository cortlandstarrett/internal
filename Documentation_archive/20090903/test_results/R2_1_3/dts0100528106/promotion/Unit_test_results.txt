This document captures the state of the BridgePoint unit tests ran against the
head branch after already promoting the issue.  We did it this way to allow a 
larger audience to test this issue ASAP to facilitate the 2.2.0 BP release.

* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"

Revision 1.1  2009/05/17 23:09:24  rmulvey
job:dts0100528106 dts0100530239
Unit test results.  These tests were performed against the head branch after promotion of this issue and several others which were promoted to head without normal promotion testing in the branches.  This was done to facilitate larger-audience testing in preparation for the R2.2.0 release.  There are problems here that need to be investigated.  They are described in the test promotion test result check list here:  Documentation/internal/test_results/R2_1_3/dts0100528106/promotion/Unit_test_results.txt

The other issues that were promoted that must be considered when investigating these problems are:
dts0100530239 - Support for Constants still not in place in BridgePoint

dts0100588041 - ACT_ACT is associated with the wrong model root after a formalize or unformalize operation

dts0100543547 - [BZ 2798] Cannot assign UDTs of same core type

dts0100586888 - Domain marking files are not created for formalized components
