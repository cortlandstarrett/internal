* Notes:
--------
1) Results log not written, see issue 3280
2) ...bp.io.mdl.test.pkgcm.restore.PkgCMRestoreTestSuite    Broken, untestable
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc2020.test			            Broken, untestable
4) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.test			            Broken, untestable
5) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6 expected errors:
	The i3099 implementation note contins this info:
		The following tests are expected to fail until the next chunk of
		verifier work is complete:
			testExecuteClassBasedOperationWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalNotAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteInterfaceOperationWithParameters

		These 2 are races conditions, so they may sometimes pass:
			testInterfaceExecutionSignalNotAssignedCurrentExecutingAction
			testInterfaceExecutionOperationCurrentExecutingAction

6) Core Suite II											10 expected errors
    Currently there are 4 tests that are failing due to location differences
    in the draw logs.  The tests are:
        testCreateInformalSequenceUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalCommunicationUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalUseCaseUnderComponent()
        testCreateInformalActivityUnderComponent()

    There are also 6 failures due to canvas draw logs not reflecting what is on
    the canvas (Bug 3522 opened for these):
        testFormalizeMessageWithBridgeOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithFunction()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedOperation()
        testFormalizeMessageWithClassBasedEvent()
        testFormalizeMessageWithInstanceBasedEvent()

7) IO MDL Test Suite	8 expected failures
    log file present failures.  These will be resolved by issue 3491.
8) [5/9/2008 1:57:26 PM] Travis London says: I am going to pass on 3490 for
   promotion, but there are some timing related test failures in io.mdl PKG
   CM Test suite (big suprise).  When I do the next bit of work I will work
   these timing failures out.  Of course the promoter may or may not see them.
