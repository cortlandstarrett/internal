This is a batch commit of 2009 copyright changes to branch Review-i4060.  This includes the

Revision 1.1  2007/07/27 13:54:36  rmulvey
Job:2924
Introduced document with summary of my test results in the promotion workspace.  Tests are now passing.  I had trouble with :
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.als.oal.test
Core Suite
IOMDLTestSuite
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.text.test

However, I did a clean build (a second time), retested, and the problems went away.
