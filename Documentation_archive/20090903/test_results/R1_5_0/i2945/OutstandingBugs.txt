BridgePoint Technical Note
Informal bug tracking list for the nested components work (i2945)

Open Issues:
------------
Entered 6/27 High.
We need to support terminations on drag and drop.  The design note calls for
this.  It is more needed now with the auto-creation of Imported Component
interface references.

Entered 6/27, Medium
Parse All works for OAL in formalized and unformalized components, but it does
not work to parse the OAL of components nested within the selected component.

Found 06/21 High
We need to trigger the code to set graphical representation when reconciling.
This is needed when restarting the tool with a diagram open, if it needs to find
a graphical element from another diagram.

Found 06/18 Low
plugin schema checking is broken. You're not supposed to be able to just add
attributes to the plugin without updating the schema to let Eclipse validate it.
We didn't do this for the autocreate changes, but no errors were flagged.

Todo High.
We need to have satisfactions written to the diagram's file and not the
Component's file as is today.

Todo High.
We need to have delegations written to the diagram's file and not the
Component's file as is today.

Found a while back... Medium
We need to fix PHMD.getChildren to return subsystems as children of a domain.

Todo Low
We need to support auto-create of datatype shapes at the very least.  We need
this so that when a domain is unformalized the domain dt's graphics are
restored.  Undo will correctly restore the elements. This lower priority after
the changes made for the 1.4.5 release. This release hides the graphics rather
than deleting them and so is able to restore them. Reducing priority
accordingly.

Found 06/21 Low
Interface Property consistency errors reported. Across R4007 and R4008. Looks
like the data type isn't being set up correctly at initial creation.

Note: This is caused by model-root boundary issues.  The consistency checker
does not honor cross model-root associations.

Found 6/22 High
"Link with Editor" option doesn't work for delegations.
_- Use the "Fitness Motivation Device" model
_- Select "Link with Editor
_- Open the GPS Component 
_- Select the GPS Control delegation
_R The GPS Control interface is NOT selected in ME under
   Ephemeris
_- In ME select the GPD:Ephemeris:GPS Control interface
_R The delegation in not selected on the canvas

"Link with editor" is broken for all domain elements after formalization.
Increasing priority of this issue accordingly.

Entered 6/27, High
Work on the Fitness Motivation Device/GPS System example models.
[12:27:50 PM] Bob says: OK
[3:03:58 PM] Bob says: Is anyone woking on the GPS/Fitness Motivation Device 
             models?   I think we need to incorporate the data_acquition SS from 
             the orginal GPS back into the GPS component.  This SS has some 
             classes and ISMs that still make sense and can be used.
[3:05:23 PM] Bob says: with Travis' change yesterday (or whenever it was), the 
             GPS Component is now in a Component Package named GPS System 
             which is an imported compoent in Fitness Motivation Device.
[3:05:24 PM] Travis London says: You also may want to wait until domain 
             formalization is good, Campbell has surely worked out some bugs.
[3:06:30 PM] Bob says: OK, I think we'll want this sample in good shape so we 
             can send it with the Alpha.
[3:09:58 PM] Bob says: We'll probably want the stuff in the api function 
             package too (for verifier).  I'll put this in our TODO list.

Entered 6/30, Med
The follow was added to bp.io.mdl/arc/create_persistence_meta_data.arc and will
need to be properly resolved before final release.
.// TODO FIXME: This is a hack to get assure Subsystems are included
.//             after a component is formalized to a domain.  It has 
.//             been added on 2007-06-30 to allow us to prepare an 
.//             Alpha release, but will need to be fixed properly
.//             before final release.

Reported: 7/10 Medium
The component formalize wizard takes a long time to run, it really needs a
progress bar (I know this would need a lot of infrastructure, maybe the effort
would be better spent speeding up the formalization itself).

Reported: 7/10 Medium
Related to the above, FindAllComponents appears to be slow and doing more
loading than it should.

Reported 7/10 Medium
Formalize wizard entries for models that have been modified in some ways (e.g.
Team Replace and component formalize followed by unformalize), are moved to the
end of the (otherwise alpha sorted) dropdown list. This can lead a user to
incorrectly conclude that the model they are seeking is not available for
formalization. Restart of the tool restores the model to the correct position.

NOTE: These drop down lists are not alpha ordered.  This same problem occurs
with any element provided in a wizard's drop down list.

Reported 7/10 High
Model Listener notification seems to be turned off almost immediately when
editing component diagrams.

Closed Issues:
--------------
Found 06/18 Medium, Fixed.
Creation of an interface reference must not be allowed if drawn to another
interface reference that is formalized to an interface which is not within the
scope.  This can occur when drawing to an imported component's reference.

Found 06/21 High, Wont Fix.
Something is causing a resource change listener to exit when it shouldn't.  
However, there is no error log entry to indicate that the listener exited
abnormally.
_- Using the "Fitness Motivation Device" model
_- Rename Ephemeris to test
_- Replace whole model with latest from head
_R The model is restored as expected
_- Rename Ephemeris to "test"
_R Canvas shows no change
_- Touch the canvas by clicking on an empty spot
_R The name "test" is now shown on the canvas
_- Replace whole model with latest from head
_- No changes are displyed
_- Touch the canvas by clicking on an empty spot
_R Incorrect data is displayed
_- Exit and restart
_- The model is displayed correctly

Note: I tried to reproduce this on a smaller level.  I was unable to with a few
changes to the modelElementReloaded method of CanvasEditorListener.  The changes
fix what was partly the issue, but with the Models project there is still
something causing the listener to not work properly.  This will not be fixed
with this issue as those problems are not directly related to Component
diagrams.


Found 06/21 Medium, Fixed
Port names should be initialized to something. Port - 1 etc. will be fine.

Found 06/21 Medium, Fixed
The actionFilter for requirements must be looked at so that Unformalize is
disabled on IRs connected to imported components.  Same goes for provisions.

Found 06/26 High, Fixed
We need to either cause persistence when connectors are
auto-created/auto-removed, or we need to call the reconcilation code more often.
Maybe call it during load.  Without this the reconciled connectors are not
available on restart.

Todo High, Fixed.
When a delegation creation causes a floating connector to be created that newly
created connector needs to be the anchor for the delegation.

Found 06/21 Medium, Fixed.
Informal Interfaces on Component Diagram do not suppress the Required I/F Label
when the labels are the same across a satisfied connection. This works OK on a
Component Package Diagram.

Todo High Fixed
Need to support migrating a connector's anchor to a shape when specified in the
ES.  This is required when a delegation is drawn to an interface reference.

Found 06/15  Medium, Fixed.
Interface reference connectors on container symbols snap back instead of
cropping if the interface end is not dropped exactly on the edge of the symbol.

Found 06/18 High, Fixed.
Interface references not removed when an imported component is reassigned. If
an attempt is made to delete the interface reference, there is no visible
effect, but the interface reference that gets deleted is the one on the original
component. If the imported component is later removed, the orphaned interface
references are left on the diagram and cannot be deleted.

Found 06/18 Low, Fixed.
The selection criteria for Interface reference connectors on a selected
component is inconsistent with the same symbol on an unselected component
symbol. In the latter case, clicking anywhere in the port symbol will select the
connector. In the former case the behavior is different for container component
and regular component symbols. For container symbols, you have to click on the
line of the connector itself. Nowhere on the port will do. For a regular
component symbol anywhere in the prot will work, so long as it is outside the
selected component symbol.

Found 6/19 Low, Won't Fix
Name compartment text in a component diagram can be hidden by a nested 
component, imported component, interface, or even a port that is above the name 
compartment.  We should not allow this text to be obscured.

Found 6/18 High,fixed
Autocreated connectors are always placed in the middle of the element.  They
need to be placed in the same relative position the are in in the original 
component (or multiple connectors are draw on top of each other).

Found 06/18 High, Fixed
We need to disable "Delete" for interface references on imported components.

Found 06/18 High, Fixed
We need to tear down satisfactions that are made with an imported component when
the imported component is unassigned.

Found 06/19 High, Fixed.
Direction isn't allways shown in delegation and multiple delegation lines are
allowed to be drawn.
  After recreating the GPS model (in head) I'm having some trouble in the 
  delegation example (Satellite Package::Satellite Alpha::Location Module)
  When I try to draw delegation from Triagulation to the port on getLocation it 
  allows me to draw multiple lines, but none of these lines show direction.

Found 06/21 High, Fixed
Formalizing a satisfied Interface causes stack overflow.

Found 06/21 High, Fixed
Can't Formalize a Provision.

Found 06/21 High, fixed
_- Using the "Fitness Motivation Device" model
_- Rename Ephemeris to test
_- Replace whole model with latest from head
_R Text on the formalized interfaces is lost

  Similiarly:
_- Using the "Fitness Motivation Device" model
_- Unformalize  the relationship between Epheneris and Radio Controller
_- Replace whole model with latest from head
_R Text on the formalized interfaces is lost
_- Unformalize the same relationship again
_R The provided interface from Radio Controller is lost

Todo High, fixed
The consistency code does not use the attribute prefix for referential
attiributes in the parameters passed to the class query interfaces.

Found 06/21 High, fixed
Initially only one Port is shown an a container component that has two identical
formalized interface references drawn to it on the digram above. This is as
expected. Deleting one of the references on the diagram above, the associated
with the single duplicated symbol on the diagram below caused the reconciler to
'switch' to the other remaining interface. Again this is good behavior. After
this, however, Undo failed to remove the second interface. Removing and
redrawing the Provided interfaces replaced both interfaces on the lower diagram.

Around this time the error log showed new errors of the form (may or may not be
related):
