BridgePoint Technical Note
Informal bug tracking list for issues found while testing R1_5_0 (i2717)

Open Issues:
------------
Entered 8/24 
Complete i3049 (upgrade 1.4.2 models)
Current implementation of the update code needs to be rethought.
Currently the update code requires all PMCs to be persisted. This puts us  
in the situtation where a group of files get marked dirty when the project is 
opened.  Without this, the upgrade code works, but if you make a change and 
restart, you will see many issues.

Entered 8/24
You cannot open the diagrams for imported elements.  It may also only happen 
when the exported model was upgraded from 1.4.2.
	Without upgrade:
		_- Create a component package
		_- Export the package to a file
		_- Import the package
		_R Package is imported ok, name reflects duplicate found
		_- Double click the imported package
		_R The Diagram opens (note failure here)

	With upgrade:
		Repeat above steps but on a component package that was upgraded from 
		1.4.2.

Closed Issues:
--------------
Entered 8/24
	After checking out the Models project in a runtime workspace no models 
	inside that project are present in ME.
	I see the following before Models can be completely loaded:
	
	Unhandled event loop exception
	Reason:
	For input string: "'Test Interface'"
	Unhandled event loop exception
	Reason:
	For input string: "'ComponentTestInterface'"
	Unhandled event loop exception
	Reason:
	The test models that contained components and were created with the 1.4.5
	alpha release need to have their persistence version updated from  7.1.3 to 
	7.1.4

Entered 8/24
	Formalization of interfaces is lost on restart.
	_- Create an interface
	_- Create a Component with an provided interface and formalize the interface
	_- Restart
	_R When you open the component package the interface is no longer formalized
	_R Note this has severe implecations on imported components
	Resolution:
		This issue went away when the latest model update code was put in place.
		We are still a bit worried that this sort-of magically went away...
		Note that initial case found was more complex, it follows, but the 
		problem was isolated as described above.
		_- Create Comp Pkg (CompPkg1)
		_- Create Comp Pkg (ImportPkg)
		_- Create an Intrf Pkg (IntrPkg)
		_- In the IntrPkg create 2 interfaces (i1 and i2)
		_- In ImportPkg create 2 components (Comp1 and Comp2) 
		_- Creata a provided and required interface from Comp1 and formalize 
		   each of them to i1
		_- Creata a provided and required interface from Comp2 and formalize 
		   each of them to i2
		_- In CompPkg1 create 2 components
		_- In CompPkg1 create 2 imported components
		_- Assign one of the imported compoents to ImportPkg:Comp1 and the other 
		   to ImportPkg:Comp2
		_- Restart the tool
		_R CompPkg1 is not open even though it was left open when the tool was 
		   restarted
		_R The connectors on the imported components are gone (they are just 
		   line with no ends)
		
Entered 8/24
	Many als unit tests are failing since the latest component upgrade 
	code was added.  The unit tests need to be rerun when the imprt code is 
	complete. 
	See Documentation/internal/test_results/R1_5_0/i2717/Unit_test_template.txt

Entered 8/24
Duplicate interface operations and signals are displayed
	- Create project
	- create interface package "if1"
	- Add two interfaces "i1" & "i2"
	- Add operation to i1
	- Add signal to i2
	- create component pkg "cp1"
	- Add two components "c1" & "c2"
	- c1 provides i1 and requires i2
	- c2 requires i1 and provides i2
	- connect them
	- import model "dogs" named as "goo"
	- assign c1 to goo
	- double click interfaces in the component diagram bringing up their editors, close them
	- expand cp1 > goo > Port1 > i1 and cp1 > goo > Port2 > i2
	- BUG: note two "unnamed signal" signals as part of i2
