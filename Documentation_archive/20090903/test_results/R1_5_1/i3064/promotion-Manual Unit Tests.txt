9.1 Initialization tests

x- Create a project (foo)
x- Create interface package (ipkg)
x- Create an interface (i1)
x- Create a component package (importPkg)
x- In importPkg create a component (c1) 
x- importPkg:c1 should require the interface ipkg:i1
x- Create a component package (cp1)
x- In cp1 create 2 components (c1 and c2) 
x- Create a provided interface from c1
x- Create a provided interface from c2
x- In cp1, create an imported component and assign it to importPkg:c1
x- Drag the provided interface from c1 to the required interface of importPkg:c1
xR Satisfaction is made and both sides are formalized
x- Drag from the satisfaction that was just made to the provided interface
   coming from c2.
xR Satisfaction is not made.
