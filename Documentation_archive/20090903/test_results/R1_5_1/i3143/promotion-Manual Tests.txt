7.1 Verify that the problem with the customer model is fixed.
x- Get the customer workspace from [1] comment 6.
x- extract the workspace_BP150_CrashOnExport.zip to a location that you can
   select as an Eclipse workspace (nothing else should be in this folder)
x- Launch BP and point to the workspace created above
x- Open the SPD
xR See one orphaned element, one CP, and one DT package
x- In the xtuml perspective select the model, right click and select
   Export->BridgePoint Model
x- Select Next
x- Unselect the CPP model
xR No stack overflow occurs
x- select the CPP model
xR No stack overflow occurs
x- Export the model
xR No Stack overflow occurs

7.2 Test case built while isolating the problem
x- Create a xtUML project (i3143)
x- Create a CP (cp1)
x- Create an IP in cp1 (ip1)
x- In ip1 create 2 interfaces (i1, i2)
x- In cp1 create a component (c1)
x- c1 has a provision formalized to i1
x- Export->BridgePoint Model
x- Select Next
x- Uncheck cp1
xR No stack overflow.
