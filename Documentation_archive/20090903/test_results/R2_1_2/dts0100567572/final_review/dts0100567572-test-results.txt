* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) 4 Displaced graphics failures.
5) Two timing related failures in CVS interaction.
6) 3 Delete test failures, all similar:
2 x org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException:
        Resource '/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.mdl.deleteTest' does not exist.
  at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkExists(Resource.java:310)
1 x org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException:
        Resource '/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.mdl.deleteTest' is not open.
 at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.checkAccessible(Project.java:97)
Examination of test folder shows com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.mdl.deleteTest is
present. Possibly a race condition?
7) I always see some slight graphics relocation in this test for some reason.
8) Cannot find the GPS project in the workspace. It is indeed missing, I can
find matching projects in CVS but checking them out into my workspace does not
cause the projects to be found.
