* I am skipping this long running test as the change in question has no bearing
  on the functionality of the parser.
  
** I have seen these sorts of errors intermittently.  I'm skipping investigation
   of these issues as they are not relevant to the change in question.

* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
