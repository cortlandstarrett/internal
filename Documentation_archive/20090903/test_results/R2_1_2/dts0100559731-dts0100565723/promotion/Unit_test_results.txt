* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Had one small difference in draw location which doesn't matter.
5) Two timing related failures in CVS interaction.

Revision 1.1  2009/09/03 18:26:57  rmulvey
job:dts0100616734
Archive documentation and other development notes following the R3_0_0 release.  These are being archived under Documentation/internal/technical/archive/20090903

Revision 1.5  2009/03/22 01:25:38  rmulvey
Job:dts0100572189
Updated documentation to reflect that there is a known failure in debug.ui.  ClearQuest issue  dts0100573488 has been entered to address it, and it is marked critical/resolve immediately.

Revision 1.4  2009/02/23 18:30:07  kbrown
job:dts0100559731 dts0100565723
Re-ran canvas and iomdl2 under the debugger and got down to just a few minor and ignorable errors.

Revision 1.3  2009/02/23 17:37:53  kbrown
job:dts0100559731 dts0100565723
Updated unit test results matrix.  Down to 2 failing tests.  I think at least one is a configuration or timing issue on this test machine (my laptop).

Revision 1.2  2009/02/23 04:41:42  rmulvey
Job:dts0100565723 dts0100559731
