* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Repeated failures of the form:

org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Problems encountered while moving resources.
 at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.move(Resource.java:1370)
 at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.move(Resource.java:1327)
 at com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.common.ComponentTransactionListener.modelElementRenamed(ComponentTransactionListener.java:474)
!MESSAGE Problems encountered while moving resources.
!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.core.resources 1 4 2009-04-07 21:27:12.551
!MESSAGE Could not move '/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.canvas.test'.
!STACK 1
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Could not move: C:\mgc\BridgePoint\eclipse\bp_tests\text\com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.canvas.test.
 at org.eclipse.core.internal.filesystem.Policy.error(Policy.java:55)

  These happen in different tests at different times, also affected by what
  breakpoints are set. One such combination allowed the test to pass. Raised
  issue dts0100579717 to track this.
