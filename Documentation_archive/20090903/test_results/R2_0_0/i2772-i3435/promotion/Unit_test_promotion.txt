* Notes:
--------
1) Results log not written, see issue 3280
2) ...bp.io.mdl.test.pkgcm.restore.PkgCMRestoreTestSuite    Broken, untestable
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc2020.test			            Broken, untestable
4) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.test			            Broken, untestable
5) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6 expected errors:
	The i3099 implementation note contins this info:
		The following tests are expected to fail until the next chunk of 
		verifier work is complete:
			testExecuteClassBasedOperationWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteSignalNotAssignedToTransitionWithParameters
			testExecuteInterfaceOperationWithParameters
			
		These 2 are races conditions, so they may sometimes pass:
			testInterfaceExecutionSignalNotAssignedCurrentExecutingAction
			testInterfaceExecutionOperationCurrentExecutingAction
6) Core Suite II											2 expected errors
	Issue 3208 changed timing of tests that result in 2 compare errors.
	The test results were not updated because a fix for the timing issue
	will be applied with another issue that is coming soon.
	Here are the 2 lines that are different:
        Transaction started: Auto-reconcilation
        Transaction Ended: Auto-reconcilation with delta size: 0
