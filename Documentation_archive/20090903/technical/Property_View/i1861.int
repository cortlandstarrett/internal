Tiger Project Implementation Note
Implementing Properties-View-Related Usability Enhancements


Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation for a few different usability 
enhancements that are all in some way related to the properties view.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 1861
[2] MRD: Marketing_Documentation/internal/requirements/MRDs/MRD119.doc

Background
----------
The requirements for this issue are described in [2].

Design
------
1.
In core.ui.perspective.BridgePointPerspective, the properties view is moved
to below the perspective's main editing area.

2. 
In the BuildPropertySource.arc archetype of ui.properties, the expert 
designation is removed from properties that were previously only shown if 
the "Show Advanced Properties" button of the properties view was depressed.

3.
In ui.properties, two new classes are added.  One of them, 
BridgepointPropertySheetPage, is added to allow employment of the second class,
BridgepointPropertySheetSorter, as the properties sorter in the tool's 
properties page.  This new custom sorter orders the "Basic" category of 
properties first, and the rest alphabetically.  

The getPropertySheet() methods of ui.canvas.CanvasEditor and the 
create_explorer_view.inc archetype of ui.explorer are modified to now return
an instance of BridgepointPropertySheetPage, rather than a plain 
PropertySheetPage.

The two new classes are added to the cvs_java_files property of ui.properties'
generate.xml file.


Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1.
In core.util.UIUtil, dispatchAll() and getPropertyTree() utility methods 
were added.

2.
The second of the two unit tests below was automated in a new class, 
properties.test.PropertiesViewTest2.  In the same plugin's generate.xml, 
PropertiesViewTest2 was added to the cvs_java_files property, and was excluded 
from the code formatting target.  In the plugin.xml file, the canvas and 
canvas.test plugins were added to the list of dependencies, as one of the 
new tests opens a canvas editor.

3.
In test.TestUtil, a sleepWithDispatchOfEvents() utility method was added, 
intended for use as a debugging aid.

4.
In text.test.ActivityEditorInteraction, the implementation of getProblemView() 
was replaced with a call to WorkbenchPage.findView(), since the old way was 
failing due to the problems-view now sharing its tab-group with the properties 
view.

5.
An informative comment was restored to the IdAssigner class.


Unit Test
---------
- start the tool
- close any existing xtUML modeling perspective
- open a new xtUML modeling perspective
R the properties view is shown below the main editing area, in the same tab 
	group as the problems view
	
- open a class diagram of a model
- select an association
R the "Basic" properties category is listed first in the properties view, 
	and the rest of the categories are alphabetically sorted afterwards
R all properties of the association are shown, whether or not the "Show 
	Advanced Properties" button of the properties view is depressed
