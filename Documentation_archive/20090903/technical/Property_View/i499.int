Tiger Implementation Note
Leverage Basic and Advanced Properties Feature

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes needed to improve the initial look of the
Property Viewer by leveraging the Basic and Advanced Properties button.

[2] bp.core/doc/internal/technical/Property_View/property_view.ant|dnt

Background
----------
The current properties viewer overwhelms the user with too much information.
The specification for the properties viewer is changed so that when Basic mode
is in use, only the immediate attributes of the selected metamodel element are
shown. In Advanced mode, the user can see and drill down into the related meta-
model entities as originally specified[2].

Design
------
i499.1  Add the Basic category to the generated Property Provider classes.
This is done by calling setCategory() on the appropriate property descriptors
in two places in BuildPropertySource.arc, the archetype that generates the
Property Source classes for each metamodel element. The two places are:

  - Where a simple attribute is shown.
  - Where a meta association is marked as user modifiable

i499.2  Add the Advanced filter to the generated Property Provider classes.
This is done by using the setFilterFlags call, passing the predefined
flag value IPropertySheetEntry.FILTER_ID_EXPERT. This is done in all places
where a meta-association is NOT marked as user modifiable.

Work Required
-------------
i449.1 Add the Basic category to the generated Property Source classes
The changes are made to com.projtech.bp.ui.properties/arc/
BuildPropertySource.arc, as described in the design.

i449.2 Add the Advanced filter to the generated Property Source classes
The changes are made to com.projtech.bp.ui.properties/arc/
BuildPropertySource.arc, as described in the design.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
- Start Tiger
- Import odms.mdl
- Select the Disk Class
- Focus the Property Viewer.
- Ensure the Advanced Properties button is not latched.
R Only the Class Description, Key Letters, Name and Number are shown in the
  Properties View.
_ Click the Advanced Properties button
R The attributes of the class and its state chart are also shown and can be
  opened and explored.

- Execute all existing unit tests
R All tests pass
