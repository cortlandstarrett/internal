Tiger Implementation Note

Fix SEME property display

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to have the SEME property viewer display the 
correct data.

Bugzilla Issue 955

Background
----------
When examining SEME data for a transition that is not reflexive, the 
'To' field in the data is always the initial state, not the final state.

Design
------

A State Event Matrix Entry (SEME) is concerned with two states: the initial 
state and the final state.  These two states are described by the properties
view as the 'In' state and the 'To' state.  The Property View has a descriptor
for attribute of a model element.  In the case of the SEME, the descriptors
for the 'In' state and the 'To' state are the same: 'States'.  When the view 
gets the value for an attribute, the search algorithm uses the descriptor
name.  Since the descriptor is the same for both states, the query routine
returns the same value for both the 'In' state and the 'To' state.

1.  Change descriptor identifiers

The property view data is generated from ooaofooa_hierarchy data in core.
The property view descriptor identifier is created from the T_TNS.categoryName
attribute.  The descriptor is changed to concatenate the T_TPS.NameOnly after
the categoryName attribute.  This string is used to create the variables
used to store the descriptors (which are required by Java to be unique), so it
makes sense to use the same string to identify the descriptors themselves.
With this new identifier, the 'In' and 'To' states are shown correctly.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------

The unit test generation archetype (create_view_test.arc) is changed to 
generate the descriptor id in the same way as the property view.


Code Changes
------------

Changes should be made to branches HEAD and R1_0_HEAD
Review branch is Review-i955
