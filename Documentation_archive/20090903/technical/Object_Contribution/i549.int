Tiger Implementation Note
Allow referentials to be combined and split

Abstract
--------
BridgePoint builder allows the user to document formal constraints on the
formation of relationships between instances in a model. This is done by
combining referentials where they have the same base attribute. Once an
attribute may be combined, the ability to split it is also needed. This
note describes how this functionality is implemented.

Background
----------
The functionality provided by BridgePoint 6.1 is re-created in Tiger to
combine and split referential attributes.

Design
------
i549.1   Referential Combination

i549.1.1 Add new CME entry
A new CME instance is added to context_menu.pei.sql as described in the design.

i549.1.2 Create new CME Function, O_ATTR_CombineWith
The changes are made to cme_functions.sql as described in the design.
The new operations combine_refs and alreadyCombinedWith are added to the 
Referential Attribute class in ooaofooa.mdl and .bak as described in the design. 
The parts not elaborated in the Design note (the TODO sections) are described 
below:

//combine_refs: find last O_REF in self's ref list R112
select any ref related by self->O_REF[R108];
   select one next_ref related by ref->O_REF[R112.'precedes'];
   while (not_empty next_ref)
     select one next_ref related by ref->O_REF[R112.'precedes'];
     if (not_empty next_ref)
       ref = next_ref;
     end if;
   end while;
   
(ref is the last O_REF in the list)

//combine_refs: add other_ref to self's ref list R112
relate other_ref to ref across R112.'succeeds';
     ref = other_ref;    
     

i549.1.3 Add new Action Filter to Attribute
A MEF instance is added to context_menu.pei.sql, with the action filter
arguments 'can' 'combine'.  The Attribute.actionFilter operation is updated
to process these parameter values. The following 'elif' branch is added to 
Attribute.actionFilter in ooaofooa.mdl:

elif ( param.value == "combine" )
   select one rattr related by self->O_RATTR[R106];
     if ( not_empty rattr )
        select one base_attr related by rattr->O_BATTR[R113];
         select many candidate_set related by self->O_OBJ[R102]->O_ATTR[R102]->O_RATTR[R106]
           where selected.BAttr_ID == base_attr.Attr_ID and 
                 selected.BObj_ID == base_attr.Obj_ID;
           for each candidate in candidate_set
             if ( not rattr.alreadyCombinedWith( id: candidate.Attr_ID ) )
               return true;
             end if;
           end for;
     end if;
   return false;

i549.2   Referential Split

i549.2.1 Add new CME entry
A new CME instance is added to context_menu.pei.sql as described in the design.

i549.2.2 Create new CME Function, O_ATTR_Split
The changes are made to cme_functions.sql as described in the design.
A new operation split_refs is added to the Referential Attribute class in 
ooaofooa.mdl and .bak as described in the design.

i549.2.3 Add new Action Filter to Attribute
A MEF instance is added to context_menu.pei.sql, with the action filter
arguments 'can' 'split'.  The Attribute.actionFilter operation is updated
to process these parameter values.  The following 'elif' branch is added to 
Attribute.actionFilter in ooaofooa.mdl:

elif ( param.value == "split" )
   	select one rattr related by self->O_RATTR[R106];
   	if ( not_empty rattr )
   	  select many ref_set related by rattr->O_REF[R108];
   	  return cardinality ref_set > 1;
     end if;
    return false;  
    
i549.3  Change Referential Attribute.get_name operation
The changes are made to ooaofooa.mdl and .bak as described in the design.

i549.4  Create O_REF.get_text operation
The changes are made to ooaofooa.mdl and .bak as described in the design.


Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The unit test testReferentialAttributeGetName() failed after the changes were
made.  The reason is that the ReferentialAttribute.get_name operation is 
modified so that all the relationships that the attribute formalizes are 
included.  As a result of this modification, even for the basic case of just one
relationship, the relationship is appended next to the attribute name in 
parantheses, whereas in the previous implementation, only the attribute name is 
returned.  Hence, the expected result for the test case 
testReferentialAttributeGetName() is modified to reflect this new behavior.

Unit Test
---------
All the unit tests as described in the design note pass.
