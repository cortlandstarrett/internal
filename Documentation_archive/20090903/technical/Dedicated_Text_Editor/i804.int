Tiger Project Design Note
Binary placeholder file problematic

Abstract
--------
This note deals with the solution of the de-serialization issue related to the 
placeholder files in binary format.

History
-------
- final i804-033105-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue # 372
[2] Bugzilla Issue # 804

Background
----------

Issue 372[1] changed the format of the placeholder file to binary. It uses java 
native serialization to persist ModelElementID  in the placeholder file. This
resulted in a java.io.InvalidClassException on the de-serialization of an 
existing placeholder file using a new or updated ModelElementID class. In other 
words, this problem would require the existing placeholder files to be deleted 
after each update of ModelElementID class. For additional details see 
issue 804 [2].

Analysis
--------

In order to avoid deletion of the placeholder files on each update of 
ModelElementID class, it is required to incorporate backward compatibility. 
This can be done by defining SUID (Serialization Universal ID), thus over-riding 
default mechanism of defining SUID. Java default de-serialization code makes 
every attempt to read the data, with same SUID(s) despite of changes in the 
serializable class.  

Design
------

i804.1

Following variable is defined in ModelElementID class

private static final long serialVersionUID = 200503301007L;

In order to make value of serialVersionUID unique, date and time of this change 
is made, is going to be used. 

i804.2

Even though backward compatibility is introduced by defining serialVersionUID,
we require a mechanism that should update the existing placeholders, in order 
to persist newly introduced variables. However this change is not required for 
release 1. A separate issue is raised to incorporate ability to update old 
versions of persisted placeholders.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- Bugzilla issue # 812 has been raised as required by Design Section (i804.2).
   

Work Required
-------------

i804.1         Introduce serialVersionUID in the ModelElementID class as 
               specified in design section.
               
i804.2         Raise an issue, that will incorporate an ability to update old
               placeholders.

Unit Test
---------
_- Open a description editor for a domain.
_- Add a bookmark on a valid line with text in the editor.
_R Tiger shall create a placeholder file.
_- Exit Tiger.
_- Open ModelElementID.java file and add a new variable and compile Tiger.
_- Restart Tiger.
_- Open description editor of same domain, which was opened in previous session.
_R Editor is opened and bookmark that was added in previous session is visible.
_R Check log file, No error is generated.

**Note**  Since this unit test requires re-compiling the source code, it is not 
automated.
