Tiger Implementation Note

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- This issue re-implements the changes introduced by 768, as PlaceHolderManager
  was already listening to similar model changes. PlaceHolderManager listens 
  to SystemModel_c and Domain_c changes to recreate place holders. Following are
  details of changes in this regard
  
  com.projtech.bp.core.util.PlaceHolderUtil is modified to add method that 
  dynamically initializes the PlaceHolderManager. Any methods that referenced to
  removed files IPlaceHolder or PlaceHolder are removed.
  
  In order to enable PlaceHolderManager to keep place holder files in sync, it
  is initialized as soon as first instance of the class Ooaofooa is 
  instantiated, so that it does not miss any model change event.

  This has caused als.oal.test and internal.io.sql.test to fail.
  
  als.oal.test failed because PlaceHolderManager referred to Eclipse's 
  Workspace, therefore als.oal.test's tests are converted to Eclipse JUnit.
  
  internal.io.sql.test failed because PlaceHolderManager invokes Get_name 
  operations in order to filter out events for updating place holder files. 
  Therefore following test result files are regenerated.

  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/cme1.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/ee_empty.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/err_ee2.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/func_empty.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/func_exp.exp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/oal_function1.exp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/oal1.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/oal3.imp
  com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.test/expected_results/onef.imp

- This issue also solve problems stated in comment # 1, Issue 744. When domain
  is deleted, open editors close without any problem and no place holder files
  are left behind. Please note that Issue 744, includes some other changes that
  are not relevant to problem document comment # 1, Issue 744.
  
  Instead of merging unit test code from 744, this issue introduces a separate 
  unit test DomainDeleteTestI744 to test graceful deletion of related place 
  holders and closing of related editors. Please see unit test section of this 
  implementation note.  

- Since import did not dispatched any ModelDelta.NEW events, a new type of 
  ModelDelta is defined, ModelDelta.MODEL_LOADED. This event is dispatched by
  Import classes at the end of import.
  
  Explorer view started to show empty node on receiving this event, therefore 
  create_explorer_view.inc is modified to ignore this event.
  
- ModelElementID is changed to include latest good known name of model element,
  it represented. This is used to reserve a place holder file for a model 
  element that is temporarily un-available, like when project is closed. 
  EditorInput that is once restored by navigational history cannot be changed,
  therefore place holder file name is reserved.
  
- Since place holder files are created only when markers are present. Any code
  that was coupled with the existence of file during the life cycle is removed.
  
  FileDocumentProvider.FileSynchronizer has been over-rided to install model 
  change listener and delegate changes to new inner class ModelSynchronizer. Any 
  file changes are now ignored.
  
  Since DocumentProvider.ModelSynchronizer and 
  PlaceHolderManager.PlaceHolderStateSynchronizer respond to common 
  model changes, an AbstractModelElementListener is defined to contain the 
  common code.
    
  FileDocumentProvider.refreshFile(IFile, IProgressMonitor) has been over-rided 
  to do nothing as we do not need to refresh place holder files.
  
  FileDocumentProvider.isDeleted(element) is over-rided to check existence of 
  model element rather than file.
  
  FileDocumentProvider.getSaveRule() has been modified to combine creation and 
  marker rules as they may take place al-together.
  
  EditorListener is now removed as synchronization of place holders is done by
  PlaceHolderManager and synchronization of opened editors with the model is 
  done by DocumentProvider.

- Updating of editor titles was previously done by firing elementChanged event.
  A number of consecutive change events resulted in elementChange event, which
  updated editor's title by resetting editor input. But this caused parser to be
  invoked resulting in prolonged "Table Synchronization" thread. Therefore new
  interface IElementRenameListener is defined. 
  
  AbstractModelElementTextEditor is defined to implement this interface and 
  update the titles alone. 

  DocumentProvider is modified to add/remove IElementRenameListener and fire
  elementRenamed rather then elementChanged.
  
  OALEditor and DescriptionEditor are modified to derive from 
  AbstractModelElementTextEditor
  
- Since id of model root can be changed. ModelElementID.hashCode() is modified
  to use System.identityHashCode() for model root in its computation in order 
  to avoid rehashing any map that used instance of ModelElementID as a key 
  object.
  
  ModelElementID obtains reference of model root on its instantiation. Ooaofooa
  is modified so that subsequent calls to getInstance methods with same id and 
  different reload parameters (false followed by true) does not gets ignored.

- Since instances of PlaceHolderFileProxy such as .dsc and .oal for same model
  element share some common information. PlaceHolderEntry is introduced to hold
  this common information. PlaceHolderFileProxy is moved into
  PlaceHolderEntry.java as its inner class so that it can access the shared
  info.
  
- The test PlaceholderFileDeletionFromNavigatorTest is now removed, as it no
  more valid. If the place holder file is deleted, the editor is not closed as
  it is not dependent on physical existence of place holder file. However the
  only consequence of doing so, results in removal of markers.
  
- Models/mdl/placeholder.mdl is checked into repository, which is produced to 
  identify any problems. Issue 774 has been raised to track change that will 
  modify this model and generate place holder life cycle code from this model.

- UITextTest is modified to extend BaseTest to use its facilities. All files 
  which were previously extending UITextTest are modified to add required
  constructors.

- A check for DomainProxy instances was added to the domain rename sibling name 
  check in create_rename_action.inc
  

Unit Test
---------
See design note. 

Following Unit Test is added:
_- Load Tiger
_- Create a New xtUML Project and add a Domain
_- Add a new Subsystem
_- Add a new Class
_- Add a new Operation
_- Open Description Editors for Subsystem, Class
_- Open Activity Editor for Operation
_- Add Bookmarks in all the opened editors
_R Placeholder files for the opened editors are created
_- Close Tiger (without closing editor)

_- Re-Load the same instance of Tiger
_R All (previously) opened editors are still open
_R The PlaceHolderMap has instances of the created PlaceHolder files
_R The PlaceHolder files exist
_R Valid Markers exists

This steps of this test are added into 
bp.core.test/TigerNatureWorkspaceSetupTest.java and 
bp.core.test/TigerNatureExistingProjectsTest.java to avoid duplication of code.

Following unit test has been added to test the resolution of issue 744.

_- Load Tige and import model ui.text.test/mdl/testDescrip1.mdl
_- Open Activity Editor for any Operation
_- Add a problem marker
_R Underlying placeholder file is created
_- Open Description Editor for the same Operation
_- Add a bookmakr 
_R Underlying placeholder file is created
_- Delete the Domain
_R All Opened editors close
_R Underlying files are delted as well

**Note** While running Unit tests for ui.text the focus should be left/set on 
the running test workbench instance of eclipse to avoid any race conditions.
