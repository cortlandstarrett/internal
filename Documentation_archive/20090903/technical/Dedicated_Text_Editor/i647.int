Tiger Implementation Note
Change parse all to respect open editors

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The parseAction() function was changed to look for ActivityMarkerAnnotation's
as well as ActivityProblemAnnotation's, since if the error existed previously,
a problem annotation isn't created.

- The code for saving an activity was refactored into the method doSaveDocument.

- The DescriptionEditor.dispose() method was changed to behave exactly like
the ActivityEditor.dispose() method with regard to deleting markers.

- The DescriptionEditor.isPrefQuickDiffAlwaysOn() method was added to disable
QuickDiff by default for the description editor.

Unit Test

_R Error log file is empty

_- Create a syntax error (Assign -> Ass ign)
_- Save editor

- The ui.text.test is changed to do a parse all activites when there is an
activity editor open with no errors, and when there is one open with errors in 
the problems list.  The test verifies that the editors remain open, and that
the problem list is correct.

- Run all unit tests
R All tests pass
