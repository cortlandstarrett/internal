Tiger Implementation Note
Typing slowing down due to parser threads

Abstract

This document describe the implementation related specifications of the solution 
to this issue.

Background
----------
See Bugzilla issue # 349 [1]

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The automated test for this issue is highly prone to face a race condition
  because some external program or some eclipse background process might slow 
  down the OAL editor, causing slow typing and hence failing the unit test. 
  Therefore, it has been removed and a manual unit test has been introduced to 
  check the typing in the OAL editor.
- killParseThread() method of ActivityEditor.java has been removed as it was no 
  longer required.
Unit Test
---------
_- Start Tiger and load 'OoaOfgraphics'
_- Open activity editor for the function 'fixBPDTGraphics'
_- retype the activity
_R no typing slow down is observed.
