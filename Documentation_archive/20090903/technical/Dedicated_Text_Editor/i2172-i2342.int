Tiger Project Implementation Note
Support projects not in default location

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes required to support projects that are created
with their contents outside of the workspace location.  It also describes the
changes required to allow the model compiler plug-ins to get a valid path for
the bundle location even after the user.dir java property has been changed.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Issue 2172
[2] Issue 2342

Background
----------
Currently if you create a project without using the default location for the
contents, activity and description editors fail to open.

For issue 2342 see [2].

Design
------
1. Change method PlaceHolderManager.getFileWithUniqueName()

The reason that the editors may not be opened is that the method
PlaceHolderManager.getFileWithUniqueName() returns an IFile which is retrieved
through the method WorkspaceRoot.getFile().  The WorkspaceRoot method does not
map files which are not within the workspace path.  The method
WorkspaceRoot.getFileForLocation() is used for this purpose.

In PlaceHolderManager.java the method, getFileWithUniqueName is changed to use
the above mentioned method if the file is determined to be outside of the
workspace.  That is it does not have segments which match the workspace root.

2. Change method ModelCompiler.getPluginPath()

The method ModelCompiler.getPluginPath() is renamed to getEntryPath.  The newly
named method is changed so that it will return the path of an entry under the
plug-ins bundle.  The path is processed by the platform's resolve method which
returns an absolute path in the filesystem for the entry.  The methods which
refer to the changed method are updated to use the method correctly.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The method, TestingUtilities.createProject, is changed to allow setting the
location.

In als.oal, modify ParseAllInDomain.java to not parse on import as the tests
parse all activities as well.

In io.mdl.test, modify MCModelConsistency.java to remove calls to
setLoadPathForTests as they are not needed for the import tests.  Also, modify
IOMdlTest.java to remove the same calls.

In io.sql.test, modify IoTest.java to remove calls to setLoadPathForTests as
they are not needed for the import tests.

In ui.canvas.test, modify CanvasTest.java and OpenCanvasEditor.java to not
parse test models on import.  This prevents test failures due to an incorrect
path for a model-file.

In ui.text.test/ActivityEditorInteraction.java, add a test that creates a
project outside of the workspace and opens an activity editor.

Unit Test
---------
The below test is automated.

_- Create a project outside of the workspace area
_- Create a new model
_- Open any activity editor
_R the editor is opened

The existing tests for 2020 and 3020 will handle testing the change made in
section 2 of the design.
