Tiger Project Implementation Note
Do not launch activity editor on an attribute.

Abstract
--------
Issue 344 reports that double click on an attribute causes an editor to open
with the word ERROR in it. This note addresses this by turning off the Activity
editor on an attribute.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 344.

Design
------
Ideally, the activity editor should open automatically if the attribute is a
Derived Base Attribute, otherwise the editor opened should be the description
editor. Implementing this in a short space of time for M4 offers potential
problems with tree ordering and so a simpler solution is proposed.

The explorer and outline trees do not currently differentiate between different
kinds of attributes. This shall be left in place for the time being and the
text editor configuration shall be changed so that the coloring that marked an
attribute as bearing Action Semantics is removed. This results in the Attribute
and Derived Base Attribute being treated normally by the text package, so that
the Attribute is marked as having a description only and the
Derived Base Attribute as having Action semantics. Since derived base attributes
do not currently appear in the tree, the activity editor cannot be opened on an
MDA.

The only work required to implement the fix as proposed is to remove one markup
entry from the clr_pei.sql file in ui.text.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

Removed unit tests associated with derived attributes.

Unit Test
---------
_- Open the ODMS sample model.
_- Open the Disk class.
_- Double click the Disk_ID attribute.
_R The attribute description editor opens.
_- Run ui.text.test
_R ui.text.test passes
