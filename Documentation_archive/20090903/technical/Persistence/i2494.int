Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fix incorrect errors reported during replace with

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes required to not report errors for elements that
are being deleted due to a replace with.

Background
----------
See [1].

Design
------
1. Allow ignoring created proxy

The problem marker code collects proxies when elements are converted to a proxy.
During a replace with, the import code clears the instances that are being
reloaded then reloads with the new contents.  The old elements were being added
to this proxy list when they were being deleted.  Then the problem marker code
would find that elements that were actually deleted and not converted to a proxy
were missing.

In UmlProblem.java, the collection code is changed to test a new boolean before
adding a proxy.

In gen_import_java.inc, the archetype is changed to set the new boolean in
UmlProblem.java during the database clean up.

2. Redraw supertype and subtype in Value subsystem

There was a version of the tool that fixed up a model to include a graphics
class that didn't exist previously.  This version was ran against the ooaofooa
and had a problem where it could find the incorrect segment for a supertype
line.  This caused the funny movement behavior described in [2].  The latest
code does not have this problem, therefore the lines were redrawn such that they
are connected to the correct segment.

3. Remove debugging prints

There were about a dozen places were debug messages were being sent to stderr.
These are all removed.

4. Display progress for persistence

There is a noticable length of time when creating a new model using a large
template, which is caused by persistence.  There is currently no progress
displayed during this time and the new domain wizard dialog goes blank.

[4] notes that we need to increase persistence time and that the time should
show progress.  This work is only addressing the latter.

In NewDomainWizard.java, extend the progress dialog to include persistence
progress.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

The tests for undo/redo in core were failing due to the incorrect file name
being used in the code.  This was fixed.

New attributes have been added to O_RATTR and O_REF with the PLCM work.  These
attributes were added to the sql tables in ooa_schema of MC-Java.

Unit Test
---------
(Manual test)
_- Check out bp.core
_- Delete ooaofooa folder in the models folder
_- Convert single file model (ooaofooa) to mutli-file
_- Replace with latest in repository
_R No errors are shown in the Problems view

_- Create a new domain using ooaofooa.xtuml as template
_R Progress is shown for persistence
