Tiger Project Implementation Note
Clear existing children in resolveInstance()

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to delete children of a proxy when the
actual instance is being loaded.

Background
----------
When a component is loaded, if there is a proxy in memory for that instance,
and that proxy has children, then the children specified in the file 
being loaded for the component may be different than those in memory.
This is a problem when there are in memory instances that aren't in the
file being loaded.

Note: the design approved during the review of 12/19/05 did not work under 
further testing.

Design
------

1. Add method to remove unreferenced components

The method NonRootModelElement.removeUnreferencedChildren
(List loadedInstances) is created. The function compares the components
in the loaded instances list with the child components of this model 
element in memory.  If there is an in memory child component that is not
in the loaded instance list, then that child component is removed from
memory.

2. Add unreferenced component check during load

In ImportModelComponent.finishComponentLoad() an invocation of
removeUnreferencedChildren() is added before batchRelate() is called for
the loaded instances.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Changes made to java.arc and NonRootModelElement.java made by the previous
version of this design are removed.

The method PersistableModelComponent.findOrCreateParent() was fixed for
the case of a domain finding it's parent.

Changes for issues 1385 and 286 from HEAD are merged.

Unrelated failures in core.test were addressed.

Unrelated failures in io.mdl.test were addressed.

There were still two failures in bp.core.test, the readonly and 
write-enabled versions of the testClearingUndoRedoStacksAfterReplaceWith
test

Unit Test
---------

The following test is performed manually.  

- Open a component
- Create a new sub-component
- Replace parent component with previous from local history
R New sub-component is not shown in Model Explorer

for the following component - sub-component pairs:

Domain - Subsystem
Domain - DataTypePackage
Domain - FunctionPackage
Domain - ExternalEntityPackage
DataTypePackage - DataTypePackage
FunctionPackage - FunctionPackage
ExternalEntityPackage - ExternalEntityPackage
Subsystem - Subsystem
Subsystem - Model Class
Model Class - Instance State Machine
Model Class - Class State Machine
