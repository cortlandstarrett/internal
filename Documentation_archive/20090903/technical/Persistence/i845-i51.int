Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fix navigation from subsystem to domain

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to ensure that a domain is loaded when 
navigating from the subsystem to the enclosing domain.

History

final i845-i51-011806-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
MFP issue 51

Background
----------

When navigating from a subsystem to a domain via R43, the code assumes that
the domain and subsystem in domain instances are already loaded.  The 
following scenario illustrates the problem:

- Restart the tool with a state machine canvas open
- Push the link with editor button
- Select a state
R Tree does not open


Design
------

1. Add ensureParentAvailable() invocation

In referring.inc, the following code is added when generating the 
navigation functions (3 places):

  .// special case the S_SS to S_SID navigation is the one case where the 
  .// child component is not a referring class 
  .if ( (package.is_root and package.is_eclipse_plugin) and ((loc_obj.Key_Lett == "S_SID") and (tar_obj.Key_Lett == "S_SS")) )
    if ( loadComponent ) {
        PersistableModelComponent.ensureParentAvailable(target);
    }
  .end if

Note that all other navigations from child component to parent component
is across an assocation where the child component is the referring class
in the containment association, and navigation code is generated correctly.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

 
Unit Test
---------

The test is automated in TigerNatureExistingProjectsTest.testLinkWithEditor.

- Restart the tool with a class diagram open
- Push the link with editor button
- Select a class in the diagram
R Tree opens and class is selected.
