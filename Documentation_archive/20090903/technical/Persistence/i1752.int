BrigdePoint Project Implementation Note
Capture Source Metrics For PLCM

Abstract
--------
This note describes how Metrics were captured for use by the PLCM project.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla i1752 (http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1752)
[2] <CVS>/Documentation/internal/technical/Perisistence/i845-PLCM_1_0.ant 
[3] http://metrics.sourceforge.net/
    This is a tool for measuring source code related metrics.
[4] <CVS>/Documentation/internal/technical/Perisistence/i1752.dnt

Background
----------
To help assure the PLCM implementation does not get overly complex, the PLCM 
analysis note [2] requires source metrics to be captured and examined on a 
regular basis for the PLCM project.  Since metrics must be captured regularly 
in a way they can be meaningfully compared to each other, we must have a 
consistent procedure that is used to capture this data.  

Design
------
None

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1. The summary data was captured in html format as follows:

Legend:
  <plugin x>        == Name of a BridgePoint plugin
  <date captured 1> == Date the Metrics were captured (YYYYMMDD)
  <Branch>          == The branch Metrics were run against.
 
             DateCaptured  BranchName   CC Mean   CC Std Dev  CC Max  ...
             ------------  ----------   -------   ----------  ------
<plugin 1>

<plugin 2>

<plugin 3>

...


2. The Metrics report for PLCM is kept here:
   <CVS>/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.internal.metrics/BridgePoint_Plugin_Source_Metrics.html

3. A folder named "CSVData" exists under 
   <CVS>/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.internal.metrics that hold function-level metrics
   for all the BridgePoint plugins.   If users wish to do more detailed 
   analysis than provided by the HTML summary report than this CSV data can be
   used.  It can be imported into a tool of the users choice.

4. A readme.txt file is created that explains how to generate metrics.  This
   file is here:  <CVS>/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.internal.metrics/
	
Unit Test
---------
1. 	Execute the procedure to capture Metrics
1.1 Install the Metrics Plugin [3]
1.2 Build BridgePoint
1.3 Open a cygwin shell and run the command that captures Metrics XML data.
	_-cd <workspace>/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.internal.metrics
	_-./CreateMetrics.cmd
_R No errors are reported
_R Files named metrics-<plugin name>.xml were created

1.4 Run the utility to parse the XML files, capture our metrics, and update
    the HTML report.
    _-Open a shell
    _-cd <workspace>/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.internal.metrics
    _-perl ExtractMetrics.pl -h
      Note this shows the usage screen.
    _-Following is an example command-line:
    perl ExtractMetrics.pl -d 20060306 -b HEAD -c "Test Comment"

_R Open the HTML report (as specified in design #2) and verify that metrics
   were updated.
