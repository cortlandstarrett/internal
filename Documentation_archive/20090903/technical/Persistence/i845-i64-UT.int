Tiger Project Implementation Note
Unit tests for MFP that cover rename scenarios except for restore editors.

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation of Unit tests for MFP that cover 
rename scenarios except for restore editors.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla-mfp issue 64
[2] /Documentation/internal/plan/R1_1_0/Pkg CM Test Matrix.txt 
[3] /Documentation/internal/technical/Persistence/i845-i62-UT.int

Background
----------
MFP needs separate testing for the renaming of components as per test matrix[2].

Design
------
The Rename tests are written in a class named PkgCMRenameTest which is derived
from the RenameTest class. The RenameTest class extends from PkgCMBaseTest. 

Since all mfp unit tests follow same design pattern, please see Design 
section[3] for common design aspects.

Test Sequence
-------------
Following is the sequence of the 'Rename' unit tests implemented under this
issue for i845.

_- Open the Canvas editor (if applicable; i-e., component can be represented 
   as graphical shape in a canvas editor).
_- Open other applicable editors (canvas/description/activity) whose titles
   can be affected by the rename of the given component. (Please see Test coverage
   section to find out, which editors are applicable for given component).
_- Set focus on a given editor type as per given matrix entry.
_- Rename given component using given view (canvas/model explorer/
   resource navigator).
_R The contents of canvas editor are updated to show the renamed component
   (if canvas editor is applicable).
_R Model Explorer updates tree entry for renamed component.
_R Component File and the folder containing it, are renamed.
_R Editor tabs of all concerned editors are updated.
_R Number of children of renamed component is same as it was before renaming.
   This verifies that component registry in PMC is updated and PMC.getChildren()
   method works exactly as it did before the rename operation.
_R All components in the component tree that refer to renamed component have
   their proxy paths updated in their component files.

Repeat above sequence by focusing different type of editor as per matrix[2]
Repeat above sequence by changing the view used for renaming.

Test Coverage
-------------

Following matrix entry shows what cells are being covered for what component
in this test suite. To see reason for unfilled cells see [2] rename entry.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
Implementation Comments
-----------------------
- Each test may cover more than one cell. For example, if the test opens a 
number of applicable editors and execute the test with one of them in focus, it 
is also testing unfocused editor scenarios at the same time.
- The comment header for each test function describes the scenarios that it
  tests.
Unit Test
---------
_- Run all tests
R All tests pass
