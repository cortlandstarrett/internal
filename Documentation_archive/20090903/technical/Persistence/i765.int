Tiger Implementation Note
Update resource history for domain deletion and changes

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to add local history updates for domain deletion
and model changes.

Background
----------
A user can delete a domain with a single keypress.  When this is done from
Model Explorer, the underlying file cannot be recovered from the local history.

Design
------

It was decided that keeping the changes in the local history was better than
adding lots of dialogs.

1.  Change file deletion to be saved in local history

When a domain is deleted, the underlying file is deleted.  The call to
IFile.delete() is changed to add the KEEP_HISTORY bit flag.  This causes the
file deletion to be added to the local history.

2.  Add model changes to the local history

When any model change occurs, the change is written to the resource.  The 
current code doesn't differentiate between creating a new file, and updating
an existing one.

2.1  Detect in-place update

In the ExportModel constructor, if the path we are writing the file to is 
the same as the path of the model root we are exporting, then this is an
update.  In the update case, we create a ByteArrayOutputStream that the 
exported data is written to (this will be used later).  The non-update case
works as before.

2.2  Do a file update for update case

In the update case, after the data for the domain has been exported (i.e., 
written to the output stream), we create an InputStream from the data written
to the output stream.  We then pass that InputStream to an invocation of 
IFile.setContents(), with the keepHistory parameter set to true.
The non-update case works as before.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The class bp.test/src/.../TestResultLogger is changed to close the file after
it is written.  It is also changed to add the name of the first test to the file
name for cases where there are multiple tests run in a package, for example,
als.oal.test/OalParserTest and als.oal.test/ParseAllInDomain.

Unit Test
---------

All unit tests are done manually.

- Change to xtUML Modeling perspective
- Create a project 'test'
- Create a new (empty) domain 'test1'
- Open the Domain DPD
- Open the Datatype Package Diagram
- Delete the domain
R Diagrams closed
R Domain is removed from the tree
- Right click on the project, select 'Restore from Local History...'
R mdl/test1.mdl is in the list 
- Check test1, click Restore
R test1 domain is in the tree

- Open the Domain DPD
- Create a subsystem in test1
- Create a class in the new subsystem
- Select domain in Model Explorer
- Right click, select 'Compare with > Local History ...'
R There are three entries in the list
R The top entry has the new class as the only difference
R The middle entry has the new subsystem and class as differences
R The last entry has the new subsystem and class as differences
- Click 'OK'
- Right click, select 'Replace with > Local History ...'
- Select the middle entry, click 'Replace'
R Domain has no subsystems or classes

- Right click, select 'Replace with > Local History ...'
R There are two entries in the list
- Select the bottom entry (subsystem only), click 'Replace'
R Domain has subsystem but no classes

- Right click, select 'Replace with > Local History ...'
R There are four entries in the list
- Select the second from top (model class diff only), click 'Replace'
R Domain has subsystem and one class
