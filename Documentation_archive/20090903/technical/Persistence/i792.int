Tiger Implementation Note
Make icons have transparent backgrounds

Abstract
--------
This notes describes the changes made to give two icons transparent backgrounds.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 792

Background
----------
Two icons, newdomain.gif and newsystem.gif were created using an editor that did
not support transparent backgrounds. This note documents the changes to these
files.  The problem was initially missed because the menu background for
the Windows XP style is white.

Design
------
The files are replaced. The editing was done with Photoshop.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
_- Start the tool.
_- Customize the perspective to enable both Nucleus BridgePoint shortcuts.
_- Open the File > New menu
_R The two BridgePoint shortcut icons appear blended with the menu background,
   not on white squares.
