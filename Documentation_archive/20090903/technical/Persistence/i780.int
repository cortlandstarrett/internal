Tiger Implementation Note
Reloading Editor Contents When a Model File Changes on Disk

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1.
bp.core.util.WorkspaceUtil was introduced to hold utility methods that 
are directly related to the Eclipse workspace.  A method 
waitForWorkspaceTreeToUnlock() was added to this class that supports an idiom
for performing resource modifications from code that may be
executed during a workspace refresh, when the resource tree is locked
for modification. 

2.
A new utility method createTestProjectAndImportModel() was added to 
bp.test.TestUtil.  bp.core.test.RenameInvolvingResourceTest and 
bp.ui.explorer.test.ExplorerTest were refactored to call this new method.

3.
bp.ui.canvas.test.CanvasEditorReloadContentsTest was introduced, 
containing test testEditorUpdatesOnReload().  The class was added to 
CanvasTestSuite.

4.
getGraphicalElement() was added to the class CanvasTestUtilities

5.
bp.ui.text.test.TextTestUtil was introduced to hold utility methods 
used by the text tests. The following such methods were added to this class:

openActivityEditor()
openDomainDescriptionEditor()
getDomainDescriptionEditor()
createProblemMarker()
getEditorContents()
getMarkers()
closeEditor()
addTextToEditor()

bp.ui.text.test.PlaceHolderUpdateTest was refactored to call these methods.

6.
bp.ui.text.test.TextEditorReloadContentsTest was introduced, 
containing tests testActivityEditorUpdatesOnReload() and 
testDescriptionEditorUpdatesOnReload().  The class was added to 
the UITextSuite.

7.
The method bp.ui.text.test.PlaceHolderUpdateTest.waitForThread()
was moved to bp.test.common.TestingUtilities.

8. 
Merging this issue with the work done for 673 forced many changes to have 
to be performed.

8.1
The code in bp.core.ui.EditorListener was removed to a static utility 
method in a new bp.core.util.EditorUtil class, to make its functionality 
accessible without having to subclass EditorListener.  This also meant that no
change was made to bp.core's generate.xml file.

8.2
In bp.ui.text.AbstractModelElementListener, handling was added for 
pre-reload-all and reload-all model change events.

8.3
In bp.ui.text.AbstractModelElementTextEditor, a method 
handleElementContentReplaced() was added to handle pointing the editor to 
its new contents after its model-file has been reloaded.

8.4
In bp.ui.text.DocumentProvider, a method handleModelReloaded() was added
to ModelSynchronizer to fire an ElementContentReplaced event.

8.5
In bp.ui.text.placeholder.PlaceHolderEntry, deleteMarkers() was modified
to perform its deletions from a separate thread that waits until the 
workspace resource tree is unlocked for modifications.

8.6
In bp.ui.text.placeholder.PlaceHolderManager, a stub was added for 
handleModelReloaded() in PlaceHolderStateSynchronizer.

9.
As part of the merge for final review, the PRE_RELOAD_ALL and RELOAD_ALL 
constants were moved from bp.core.ModelDelta to the ooaofooa.xtuml model 
file.

10.
In bp.test.common.BaseTest, the creation of a test project in the constructor
is made optional, as such functionality is not always desired for every test.
