Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fix NPE when prompting user with parse all question

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to fix an NPE when prompting the user 
about parsing a resource that changed.

History
-------

final i845-i44-121905-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
MFP issue 44

Background
----------
The code that prompts the user to ask if a parse should be done 
throws an NPE if it is not running in the UI thread.

Design
------

1. Ensure that user is prompted from the UI thread.

The function CorePlugin.getParseAllOnResourceChange() will prompt the
user if the associated preference value is set to "prompt".  The prompt
uses a MessageDialog, which must be used from the UI thread.  The callers
of getParseAllOnResourceChange() are changed to ensure that the invocation
occurs in the UI thread.  The changes are made to 
ComponentResourceListener.addComponentResource() and TextPlugin.start()
(in the resource change listener).  A javadoc comment is added to 
getParseAllOnResourceChange() describing the restriction.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
