Tiger Project Implementation Note
Prevent unusable diagrams

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes that are required to prevent unusable diagrams when
replacing the diagrams contents.

Background
----------
When replacing the contents of a diagram it is possible to end up with an
unusable diagram.

Design
------
1. Catch NPE's and trigger a redraw

In the paint listener of CanvasEditor.java, the call to Model_c.Draw is
surrounded by a try clause.  This try clause catches NPE's during the execution
of the Draw method, triggering a redraw if any were caught.  This prevents the
problem of an unusable diagram as well as allows the diagram to be properly
updated.

2. Recreate instance key when restoring a deletion

Originally it was thought that this issue had something to do with undo/redo.
It didn't, but during the original investigation it was noticed that the
instance key used to store an instance in a map was not being recreated when
undoing a deletion.  A call is added to readd the instance to this map.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
It was noticed during this work that the undo/redo stacks were being cleared at
inappropriate times.  This was due to the eclipse Auto build job, sending
resource change events for the model files.  A test was added in
TransactionManager.java to ignore any change events caused by this job.

Unit Test
---------
Manual tests:

_- Check out ooaofooa
_- Open the domain class diagram
_- Delete the Domain class
_- Replace the ooaofooa with the latest from the repository
_R The canvas is updated and usable
