Tiger Implementation Note
Persisting Canvas Hotspot Movement Correctly

Abstract
--------
This notes describes the implementation for a fix to a bug where the model
is persisted before a canvas hotspot movement has fully completed.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
Bugzilla issue 773

Background
----------

Analysis
--------
When manipulating the association end of an associative link in a canvas, 
the movement is persisted when the mouse button is released.  However, 
there is an extra step to the process which checks to see if the link end 
is touching the association's connector, and if it is not, snaps the end to 
the connector's line.  This step is currently occuring after the persistance.  
Thus, if the user shuts down Eclipse right after a link end has been moved 
and had to be snapped to its association's connector, then when Eclipse is 
restarted, the link will be at the point it was before it was snapped.  

The solution to this problem is to perform the persistance only after all
steps in the process of moving a hotspot have completed, including the 
snapping-to of associative link ends. 

Design
------
1.
In the Selection Tool instance statechart, code that is in state 
"Waiting for Mouse Press over Hotspot" for putting the finishing touches on
(and cleaning up after) graphical element resizings and connector segment flexes 
is moved into state "Saving Symbol Resize", to a point before the call to 
persist the model is made.  The code can be safely removed from the former 
state as the only path through the statechart that can cause its execution 
is through the latter state.  

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
- open a model with an associative link class
- drag the association end of the link to a point not on the association's 
	connector, such that the end snaps-to that connector
- shut down Eclipse, then restart
R the link end is at the snap-to point, and not the point where it was dropped

- move the end of an association that is connected to a class to someplace 
	nearby or within the class's shape, such that the end snaps back to where 
	it was on the shape's edge
- shut down Eclipse, then restart
R the link end is at the snap-to point, and not the point where it was dropped

- create a supertype connector off of a class
- create a subtype connector off of a different class, and have it end near
	enough to the end of the above supertype connector that it snaps-to 
	that end
- shut down Eclipse, then restart
R the link end is at the snap-to point, and not the point where it was dropped
