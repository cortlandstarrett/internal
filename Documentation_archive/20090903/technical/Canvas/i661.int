Tiger Implementation Note
Creation Transitions don't show correctly

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation of a unit test to test that 
Creation Transitions are drawn correctly, and a slight modification
to bp.ui.canvas/plugin.xml to enable the correct drawing of Creation 
Transitions.


History
-------


Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue 661

Background
----------
Creation transitions do not show the 'No Event Assigned' label. They cannot be 
edited either. This is due to the fact that the plugin.xml was incorrectly 
changed at 1.29 to show CreationTransition_c as the class. All transitions
should be of type Transition_c.  This defect was missed by the Unit tests. A 
unit test is  needed to check that Creation Transitions are correctly drawn.

Analysis
--------
Change needs to be made to canvas/plugin.xml so that all types of transitions
are of type Transition_c.  A unit test should be created to verify that 
Creation Transitions are drawn properly.

Design
------
i661.1 Change plugin.xml so that all transitions are of type Transition_c

The symbol class="com.projtech.bp.core.CreationTransition_c" entry in 
canvas/plugin.xml for Creation Transition is changed to 
class="com.projtech.bp.core.Transition_c".

i661.2 Create a new unit test CreationTransitionTest.java

This unit test loads a model, draws a state, selects the CreationTransition 
tool, draws a transition from outside the state coming into the state, 
and then releasing the mouse pointer.

i661.2.1 Create an empty model

An empty model is created, and a class named TestClass1 is created in the 
subsystem, and then an InstanceStateChart is created, within which a state 
named TestState1 is created.

i661.2.2 Create method testDrawCreationTransition in CreationTransitionTest.java

Using CanvasTestUtilities, activate the CreationTransition tool, get the mouse
to point to the center of the TestState1, then do the following:

createMouseEvent((mouse.x - 200), (mouse.y - 200), "MouseDown")
createMouseEvent(mouse.x, mouse.y, "MouseMove")
createMouseEvent(mouse.x, mouse.y, "MouseUp");

This draws the Creation Transition into the TestState1.

i661.2.3 CreationTransitionTest entry is added to CanvasTestResultCreator.java

i661.2.4 CreationTransitionTest entry is added to CanvasEditorTestSuite.java

i661.2.5 CreationTransitionTest entry is added to CanvasTestSuite.java

i661.2.6 CreationTransitionTest entry is added to CanvasTestResultSuite.java

Unit Test
---------
_- Create Expected Results for Canvas.  Run CanvasTestResultSuite. See if
Creation Transition JPEG is created properly.
_R JPEG is created properly.

_- Run Canvas unit tests
_R Test passes

_- Re-introduce the error in canvas/plugin.xml for CreationTransition entry.
Run Canvas unit tests.  See if the error is caught.
_R Test fails as expected
