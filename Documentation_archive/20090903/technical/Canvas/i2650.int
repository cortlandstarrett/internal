Tiger Implementation Note
Restore last transition highlighting

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation required to restore the behavior that
highlights the last transition made when Verifier is running.

History
-------
 final - i2650-010307-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue 2650

Background
----------
Last transition highlighting got broken in the 1.4.1 release because some
changes to the connector drawing were made to support sequence diagram
Lifeline connectors.

Analysis
--------
When sequence diagrams were added, the connector draw OAL had an extra call to
GR::setLineWidth(), passing the value of self.getWidth(). This was added to
allow some connectors (specificaly Lifelines) to be wider than others.

The OAL associated with setting the transition width is in
Graphical Element.draw(), before control is passed to the subtype draw
operation. This means that the OAL to support the Lifeline width was over-
writing the setting for the width for other reasons.

The logic for determining the symbol width is moved to be all together in
Graphical Element.draw().

Design
------
i2650.1 Remove the call to GR::setLineWidth in Connector.draw()

i2650.2 Remove the logic for doubling the line width for selected connectors
        from Connector.getWidth(). The element selection and the call to
        Graphical Element.isSelected are also redundant after this change and
        are removed.

i2650.3 Modify Graphical Element.draw to obtain the width from the connector
        if necessary. Change the same operation to pass the required width to
        GR::setWidth() bridge call ('+' below indicates added OAL, the '~'
        shows modified lines).

+ // Get default line width
+ //
+ width = 1;
+ select one connector related by self->GD_CON[R2];
+ if (not_empty connector)
+   width = connector.getWidth();
+ end if;
+ //
  // if the symbol is selected, set the line width to bold
  //
  if (self.isSelected() == true AND NOT param.disable_selection)
~   GR::setLineWidth(context:param.context, w:width * 2);
  elif (CL::isHighlighted(element:self.represents))
~   GR::setLineWidth(context:param.context, w:width * 2);
  else
+   // Use the default width
~   GR::setLineWidth(context:param.context, w:width);
  end if;

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
A large number of bridges on the canvas 'Client' external entity and one bridge
on the 'Graphics Platform' external entity were marked as 'Parse Successful' in
HEAD. This caused a large number of parse errors to be reported.

Since both EE's are supplied by realized code, these bridges were marked
'Do not Parse' as part of this work.

Unit Test
---------
_- Run Verifier
_- Start ODMS and execute the 'initialize' function.
_- Open the Robot instance state chart
_- Right click on the Robot instance in the Session Explorer
_- Select 'Put in Spotlight'
_- Execute 'Mount Disk 1'
_R The Robot Instance State chart animates as the instance changes state
_R The last transition taken (always the one into the current state) is
   highlighted.
