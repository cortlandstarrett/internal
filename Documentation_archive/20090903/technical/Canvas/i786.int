Tiger Implementation Note
Fix problems when replacing models

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- On further examination,  the following operations did not require changes:

Subsystem.get_compartment_text()
StateMachineState.get_compartment_text()
EnumerationDataType.get_entries()

- The utility functions get_orphaned_element_name() and 
get_orphaned_element_kl() were created.  They return "Orphaned" and "ORPH"
respectively.

- The generation of derived attributes was changed to add the declaration
of modelRoot at the beginning of the method (java.arc).

- The ErrorPathsTest in ui.canvas.test was changed because the errors are now
placed in the .log file instead of the output log.

- The operation Domain.get_ooa_id() was created.  It returns self.Dom_ID.
