Background
----------
Currently, if a user selects multiple elements and right clicks over one of the
selected elements that element becomes selected and the others are deselected.

Design
------
1. Change right click mouse listener to retain multiple selection

In CanvasEditor.java, the mouse listener for mouse button three checks to see if
the event occured over an element.  If so, the listener changes the selection
such that only that element is selected.  This was required so that when right
clicking over an icon, the correct context menu is displayed.

Another check is added which determines whether or not only one item is
selected.  If this is the case the selection is changed to either the icon or
the shape if the cursor is not over the icon, otherwise the current selection is
not modified.

This change allows a multiple selection to remain when right clicking over
anywhere on the diagram.
