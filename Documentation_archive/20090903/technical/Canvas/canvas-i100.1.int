Implementation Comments
-----------------------
Some typos in the core build.xml file are corrected; a mis-spelling in
the ooaofooa_import_spec file dependency and create_core_plugin.arc is
added to the list of dependencies.

The project com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas.test is introduced. This project
contains the JUnit code to automatically test the canvas plugin.

To support the unit test, it is necessary to load diagram data. This
is achieved using the class com.projtech.io.sql.ImportBPSql. This
class and its constructor are made public and the method finishLoad is 
similarly made public for use by the TestResultCreator and TestCanvas
classes.

The data file file_io.pei.sql is modified to change relationship numbers
so that they reflect the new number range (now starting from 1 in the
Graphics Domain). Data to populate the drawingRRect boolean is also
removed, this attribute is no longer required and has been removed from
the model.

com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas is added to the list of project dependencies
in the com.projtech.bp.io.sql .project, .classpath and plugin.xml files.

The explorer build data, UITree.pei.sql is expanded to include the
instance statechart, otherwise these diagrams cannot be inspected using
the tool (though testing is still possible).

The plugin dependency versions in the classpaths[3] were updated at the
same time as these changes where the .classpath was being updated in any
case.

To ensure that enumeration values are consistent, enumeration are colored
with Translate:false in com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas. The enums.inc archetype
is modified to check for this coloring option and not generate classes for
enumerations marked thus.

The archetype statement.inc is modified to suppress model change messages
for synchronous creates if the subsystem has been colored not to propagate
change messages.

The pei files in com.projtech.bp.als/sql were updated so that the ooa_ids
in these files would not clash with those created as part of this work.

The .clr files found in com.projtech.bp.core/color were all upgraded to
change the keyword substitution setting to ASCII -kkv.

Raised issues i146, i147 i148 and i149 to track problems found during
implementation.

com.project.ui.canvas/arc/create_explorer_view.inc is updated to test for
null input before launching an editor. This prevents NPE's when running
with models without graphics.

Unit Test
---------
The unit test is carried out using the JUnit utility. Because the top
level CanvasEditor class has many dependencies on SWT classes, it is
impossible to provide it with an environment in which user actions
may be simulated. For this reason, the automated test focuses on the
generated classes, the top level class being Model_c. The Draw operation
on this class is invoked to test the system with different diagram data
sets.

In normal operation, an encapsulated SWT GC instance (ptGC) is passed to
the Draw operation. For test purposes, the GC is wrapped in a delegation
class (TestGC) that records each call as a string and passes the call to
the ecapsualated GC instance. At the end of each test, the recorded result
strings are compared against those in a reference file. They are each
asserted as identical. Non identical strings trigger a JUnit failure
report. The number of strings is also compared with what is stored in the
file.

For each symbol type of subsystem, external entity, class, imported
class and state, create a diagram with examples showing:
 - minimum height
 - minimum width
 - minimum size

For packages:
 - with and without Prefix letters
 - without classes defined in the subsystem
 - with one class defined
 - with several classes defined in the subsystem

For EE's:
 - with and without Keyletters

For classes:
 - without attributes
 - with attributes
 - without operations
 - with operations
 - with both
 - long attribute names
 - long collapsed referential list
 - long operation names
 - long parameter list
 - long name
 - long keyletter
 - long datatype name
 - attribute with I1
 - attribute with I2
 - attribute with I3
 - attribute with I1,I2
 - attribute with I1,I3
 - attribute with I2,I3
 - attribute with I1,I2,I3
 - with operation that does not completely fit in available
   symbol height (list truncation at previous entry expected).

For States:
 - no action language
 - a single action language line
 - several action language lines
 - long action line (expect ellipis truncation)

For associations, subtype/supertype relationships and transitions, show the
following variations:
 - single segment
 - odd number of segments
 - even number of segments
 - no phrases
 - one end phrase
 - other end phrase
 - long phrase
 - text blocks in default positions
 - text blocks in non default positions
 - reflexive

For association class connector
 - line differentiation (hatched line)
 - associative multiplicity

For transitions:
 - creation
 - final state
 - with event
 - without event

R- All tests pass without throwing exceptions or failing to match the expected
   values in the reference files. 

Current code coverage from the above tests is 39%. However, all action
language paths are exercised 100%. An issue is raised so that additional tests
and coverage filters shall be provided later to achieve 100% code coverage.

* Each of the five folders marked thus (*) above contains a number of
  files representing the results of each canvas drawing operation. The
  'jpg' files may be visually inspected with any suitable viewer.
  The file without an extension contains the same diagram (as shown
  in the jpeg) but as captured and persisted by TestGC (see Unit Test
  above). The files are not enumerated here because they are generated.
  Nevertheless, their presence in the expected results directory is
  required since the expected results should change less often than
  the code and models they are evaluated against. Some of these files
  changed between first introduction and final review, rather than
  enumerate the versions for little benefit, 1.1/1.2/1.3 is specified
  as the bulk introduced version. Canvas Test was itself enhanced to
  check for additional test cases, so some diagrams in that folder are
  at 1.4.
