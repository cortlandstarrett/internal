Tiger Project Implementation Note
Unrelate R5 when removing an associative link from a canvas

Abstract
--------
Connector dispose should look for connectors it is connected to and unrelate
them from their segment across R5. This note addresses making this change.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 398.

Background
----------
The OAL for Connector.move traverses R5 to discover if an associative connector
must also be moved. Currently disposing a connector that ends on another does
not remove the R5 association link, so the Connector.move OAL finds a segment
across R5 to which _should_ be connected an associative connector, the code
assumes that the associated connector exists but this was already disposed.

Implementation
--------------
We could add an if not_empty test to the move code so that no attempt to
manipulate the attached connector is made unless it is found. However, there may
well be other places that make this assumption. It is much better to unlink the
target segmement from the target connector across R5 when disposing the
connector so that the data structures are kept consistent.

The following OAL is added to Connector.dispose just before the final delete
statement:

select one endsOnCon related by endElem->GD_CON[R2];
if (not_empty endsOnCon)
  select one endsOnSeg related by endsOnCon->GD_LS[R5];
  unrelate endsOnCon from endsOnSeg across R5;
end if;

This first of all looks to see if the element that this connector ends on is
itself a connector. If it is, it traverses to the segment and unrelates it.

Unit Test
---------
_- Open ODMS
_- Delete Disk Ownership Class
_- Attempt to bend the association R2
_R No NPE reported at Connector_c.Move line 1979

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The test number differed from the expected, test 110 rather than 84.
Canvas Editor Interaction in HEAD is missing several calls to tests in
its test result creation method. Since the results for these tests are
checked into HEAD, they must have been created OK, but the actual code to call
them was never checked in. This is not a serious problem and is rectified here.
