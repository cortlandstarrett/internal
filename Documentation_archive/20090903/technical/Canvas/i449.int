Tiger Implementation Note
Change Graphic Element attribute type

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes needed to change the type of the Graphical
Element attribute GE_ID to unique_id.

History
-------

final i449-102105-01.rvm

Issue 449

Background
----------

The identifying attribute Graphical Element.GE_ID currently has a type
of integer.  The type should be changed to unique_id so the architecture
can take care of assigning id's.

Design
------

i449.1 Change the attribute type

i449.1.1 In ooaofgraphics, the type of the Graphical Element.GE_ID attribute is 
changed to unique_id.  Code that sets the attribute value is removed from the
state actions Shape Tool.Creating Element and Connector Tool.Creating First
Segment.

i449.1.2 In ooaofgraphics, the type of the Line Segment.GE_ID attribute is 
changed to unique_id.  Code that sets the attribute value is removed from the
operation Line Segment.initialize().  Code that sets the attribute value
is changed to an invocation of initialize() in the operation Connector.move().

i449.2  Modify MC-Java to disallow writes

MC-Java is changed so that the accessor to update an identifying attribute
of type unique_id is not generated.  This prevents any hand-written code 
from modifying the identifying attribute's value.

i449.3  Remove hand-written code for setting id values

All hand-written code that sets an id attribute value (of type unique_id)
is removed.

Work Required
-------------

i449.1 Change the attribute type

The changes are made to ooaofgraphics.bak, as described in the design.

i449.2  Modify MC-Java to disallow writes

The changes are made to java.arc, as described in the design.  The code
is refactored so that there is a single utility function, is_unique_id_id_attr,
that determines if the attribute is an identifying attribute of type unique_id.

i449.3  Remove hand-written code for setting id values

The attribute setting code is removed from gen_import_java.arc, 
ImportEESql.java, and TestParser.java


Implementation Comments
-----------------------

None

Unit Test
---------

- Rebuild tiger
R No generation or compilation errors

- Start Tiger
- Import empty.sql (from internal.io.sql/mdl)
- Open the Domain Package Diagram
- Draw three subsystems (1, 2, 3)
- Delete the second subsystem
- Draw a fourth subsystem
- Export the domain as an mdl file (i449test.mdl)
- Import the file you just exported
- Open the Domain Package Diagram
R There are three subsystems present

- Execute all existing unit tests
R junit tests io.mdl.test/IOMdlTest, io.sql.test/IOTest, 
     als.oal.test/OalParserTest, als.oal.test/ParseAllInDomain pass
R All tests pass (except for known problems in compare.test, ui.text.test,
    and text ordering problem in ui.canvas.test/testcanvasStateChart)
