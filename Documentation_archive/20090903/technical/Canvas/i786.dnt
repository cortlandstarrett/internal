Tiger Project Design Note
Fix problems when replacing models

Abstract
--------
This note describes several fixes for problems noted when replacing a
project with one that doesn't have the same data in it.

Issue 786

Background
----------
The issue describes two problems associated with replacing a project with
a different version that doesn't have a model file while data for that model
is being displayed.

Analysis
--------
There are two problems:

- NPE in Get_compartment_text

The canvas is being redrawn for a Datatype Package Diagram for a domain
that no longer exists.

- Resource /ut1/mdl does not exist.

The mdl directory doesn't exist in the newly loaded version of the project.
The code in findPlaceHolderOfDeletedModelElement doesn't check that the 
directory is there before trying to access it.  This is the only place
in the PlaceHolder class where this check is not performed.

Design
------

1.  Fix canvas redraw problems

1.1  Add check for data existing

In the CanvasEditor paint listener, a check is added at the beginning to 
verify that what this diagram represents is still present.  If it isn't then
the listener returns immediately.  Eventually the diagram editor will be closed
by a model change message from the resource listener.

1.2  Add null pointer checks in client callback methods.

Even with the tests added by section 1, the diagram can be asked to paint
before the represents() element is deleted, but after some data in that
element has been deleted.  In this case, the Domain instance is still present,
but the data type data has been disposed.   The following client callback
methods are searched for any select statements where the result is not 
checked to be non-empty.  Note that we still must check the result even for
cases where the relationship conditionality is unconditional, since the redraw
is occurring during model deletion, when the model is in an inconsistent state.

get_compartments - no selects or selects are checked

get_compartment_text - no selects or selects are checked, except:
	CoreDataType
	EnumerationDataType
	ExternalEntity
	ModelClass
	StateMachineState
	Subsystem
	UserDataType

get_connector_text - no selects or selects are checked, except:
	ClassAsSupertype
	DerivedAssociation
	LinkedAssociation
	SimpleAssociation

get_style - no selects or selects are checked

get_entries - no selects or selects are checked, except:
    EnumerationDataType
    
get_text_style - no selects or selects are checked


2. Add check for mdl folder existing

The method PlaceHolder.findPlaceHolderOfDeletedModelElement() is updated to
check that the mdl folder exists before accessing it.


Design Comments
---------------

Work Required
-------------
1.  Fix canvas redraw problems

1.1  Add check for data existing

The change is made to CanvasEditor.java, as described in the design.

1.2  Add null pointer checks in client callback methods.

The changes are made to ooaofooa.mdl (and .bak).  All methods where there
is an unchecked select are updated to add checks for the select(s).

The reflection code in Cl_c.java is refactored so that there is only
one place where the reflection error messages are generated.  These error
messages are then changed to use CanvasPlugin.logError() instead of 
Ooaofgraphics.log.println().

2. Add check for mdl folder existing

The change is made to PlaceHolder.java as described in the design.

Unit Test
---------

_- Use test model ut1 (see i767.int)
_- Use Debug with NPE detection
_- Replace with Branch M8-GBR-i767
_- Open Datatype Package
_- Replace with HEAD
_R No NPE is reported
_R There are no errors in the error log
