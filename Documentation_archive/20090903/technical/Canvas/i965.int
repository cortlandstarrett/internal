Tiger Project Implementation Note
Improve Canvas selection behavior

Abstract
--------
This note describes the design for improving the way that the canvas handles
a selection made by the user.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 965
[2] Test Track issue 30

Background
----------
Currently, when a selection is made by the user, the set of displayed elements
found across R1 is traversed to find the first item that passes the 'isOver'
test. Because this is the same set used to draw the canvas, it invariably means
that the lowest (or rearmost item) is always selected.

Design
------
This strategy is changed so that the last item found is used instead of the
first. This will always pick the item uppermost on the display.

The 'Selection Tool' instance state model state action, 'Selecting Symbol' is
modified to perform selection on the last element found to pass the 'isOver'
rule. The topmost element will then always be selected. After this change, the
OAL to find and set the selection looks like:

select many symbols related by self->CT_MTL[R102]->GD_MD[R100]->GD_GE[R1];
select any selSymbol related by self->CT_MTL[R102]->GD_MD[R100]->GD_GE[R1];
selectionFound = false;
for each symbol in symbols
  if (symbol.isOver(x:rcvd_evt.X, y:rcvd_evt.Y))
    selectionFound = true;
    selSymbol = symbol;
    // We want the last symbol, so continue iterating
  end if;
end for;
if (selectionFound)
  selSymbol.toggleSelect() ;
end if;

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
As luck would have it. One of the canvas tests happened to use a Mouse Down
event over an area where two connectors were crossing. Previously, the test
passed because the correct connector was selected by chance. The test is changed
to place the mouse down event further along the connector away from the overlap.

Unit Test
---------
Since no new functionality is proposed, it is only required that existing unit
tests must pass.
