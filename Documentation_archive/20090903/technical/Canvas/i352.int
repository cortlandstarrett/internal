Tiger Project Implementation Note
Bring tree icons into line with specification.

Abstract
--------
Issue 352 reports that tree icons do not meet the Tiger specification.
This note addresses this issue by correcting the incorrect icons.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 352.

Design
------
The changes specified in the issue[1] will be made. The labels for new
subsystem and its associated Unnamed Subsystem default name will not be
changed, since a subsystem is a stereotyped package and does not need the
package postfix. The package postfix will be removed from the instance and
class statechart entries and from the event data item tree entry. Attribute
icons are changed to match the specification. The event icon color is made
more subdued so that it blends into the tree beside the other entries better.
The icon attribute.gif is no longer referenced and is removed.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
The existing data type icon is retained for core data types to highlight the
difference between them and user defined types. The data type, function,
ee and subsystem packages had white backgrounds which looked bad in window
themes with grey menu backgrounds. The white backgrounds are made transparent.

Unit Test
---------
_- Open the ODMS sample model.
_R The top level domain entry shows a blue oval icon.
_- Open the Graphics Subsystem model.
_- Open the Datatypes package
_R The data type icons have the same colors as in the specification.
_R The enumerations have the same colors as in the specification.
_- Open the Style enumeration
_R The enumerators have the same icon and color as in the specification.
_- Open the Model class in Graphics Data subsystem.
_R The attributes are shown with a hollow green icon.
_R The operation parameters of the Model class are shown as a blue triangle.
_R Model attributes are shown as a hollow green circle.
_- Open the Model instance statechart.
_R Events are a less bright color.
_- Open the Event Data Items folder.
_R The entries under this have blue triangles.
_- Right click the Event Data Items folder, select New >
_R The Data Item entry has a matching blue triangle.
