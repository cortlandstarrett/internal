Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fixing more inappropriate associative connector snap behavior.

Abstract
--------
Issue 216 documents a fault that appears to cause an associative
connector to be cropped to a shape. This note describes the changes
required to fix this problem.

History
-------
final - i216-051404-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 216.

Background
----------
As documented in the issue, this is not the real problem. In fact,
the connector is snapping back to its last known good position,
which was attached to the end of its target line. Unfortunately,
it's target line is no longer there, so it looks like a truncation.

Design
------
The problem exists because it is possible to pick up two waypoint
sets at the same time. In many cases, this is desirable (in the case
where the waypoint is in the middle of a connector, both segments
must move). However, if an associative connector connects to its
target line very close to an end of the target line, it is possible
to pick up both the associative and target lines.

When dropped, the associative line attempts to find an intersection
with its target. When it cannot, it snaps back to its starting point,
giving the illusion of having been truncated.

The fix is to prevent an associative end point from being picked up
with its target line end. This is achieved by reorganizing the
algorithm in the state action Model::Waiting To Move Hotspot.

The algorithm is changed so that it iterates over connectors in an
outer loop instead of just iterating over all segments. This allows
us to break from the loop after the first connector is found.

Further, we check for connectors ending on connectors first, so that
associatives dropped on end points can be picked up and moved. If
this is not done, then it would be possible to get an associative
connector permanently stuck to the end waypoint of its target
connector.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
The first proposed algorithm for detecting assciatives and selecting
just the associative end was difficult to read and to prove it's
correctness. A second version was developed that more clearly
distinguished the case of the associative. This was introduced as
the final solution at revision 1.26 of the ooaofgraphics.

Unit Test
---------
_- Pick up an associative connector at the association end.
_- Drag it so that it is close to the end of its connector
   line, but not crossing it.
_- Drop the connector end.
_R The connector snaps to the end point of the line.
_- Click over the end waypoint handle and drag.
_R Only the associative part of the connector is moved.
_- Move the end of a supertype connector
_R The subtype lines move with the supertype end.
_- Run the Canvas Unit Tests
R- All tests pass.
