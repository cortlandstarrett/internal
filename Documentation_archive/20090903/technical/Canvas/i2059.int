Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fixing a Bug Which Causes Blank States on State Diagrams


Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation of a fix for a bug where a blank 
state may be drawn on a state diagram.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 2059
[2] Bugzilla issue 539

Background
----------

Design
------
1.
In ui.canvas's plugin.xml, the markup added for [2] is removed, since 
it was causing this issue's bug as a side effect.  The markup consisted of 
the following:

 <defaultFor
       class="com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.ModelClass_c"
       name="Instance State Machine"
       modelType="com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.canvas.Modeltype_c.InstanceStatechartDiagram"
       ooaType="com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.canvas.Ooatype_c.StateMachine" >
    <color r="198" g="225" b="255"/>
    <validSymbol name="State"/>
    <validSymbol name="Transition"/>
    <validSymbol name="Creation Transition"/>
 </defaultFor>

This added markup allowed double-clicking on a model-class diagram element to 
open the state diagram editor for the class's instance or class state machine.
However, these defaultFor elements are also used to populate instances of
Model Specification.  To associate Model Class with the instance state diagram 
in a Model Specification instance causes a model-class instance (instead of a 
state-machine instance) to sometimes be errantly returned from a getRepresents() 
call that takes place when a state is to be created on a state diagram.  
The errant result causes the new state to be malformed.

2.
To achieve the same desired result as the above markup, without causing the 
markup's undesirable side effect, a special case is added in 
CanvasEditor.handleOpen() to allow double-clicking on a model-class diagram 
element to open the state diagram editor for the class's instance or 
class state machine.  This special case checks whether the selected element
is a model-class and whether the defaultFor entry being processed is for the 
instance state diagram.  If both of these conditions are true, the 
code that will open a state diagram editor is allowed to proceed.


Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
- create a new xtUML project
- create a new xtUML model
- create a new sub-system
- create a new class
- create a new instance state machine
- create a new state
R the new state appears normal


1.
In ExplorerTest.testProjectOpenThenClose(), a Display.readAndDispatch()
call was added at its beginning to process a model-class selection event
that is sometimes present in the UI's queue, which causes the test to fail.  
Due to time constraints, a separate issue was opened to determine the source 
of this event.
