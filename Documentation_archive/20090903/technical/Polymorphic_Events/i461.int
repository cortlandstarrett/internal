Tiger Project Implementation Note
Allowing the Selection of Supertype Events During Event Assignment

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1.
In ooaofooa, the recursion in State Machine Event's 
isAssignedInSubtypeStateMachine and isAssignedInSupertypeStateMachine 
operations was modified to go through the hierarchy	of model classes, 
rather than the hierarchy of state machines, since any given model classe
in a hierarchy may be without a state machine.  The 
[State Machine].isSupertypeMachineOf() operation was removed in favor of 
a new [Model Class].isSupertypeOf() operation, in support of this change.

2.
In ooaofooa, code in [State Machine Event].initialize() was replaced 
with a call to SEMEvent.createDefaultMatrixEntries().

3.
In core.test's CoreTestSuite, PolymorphicEventAssignmentTest was added to
the suite.  The model PolymorphicEventAssignmentTest.xtuml used by the 
tests in that class is added to core.test.  PolymorphicEventAssignmentTest.java 
was added to the cvs_java_files property in core.test's generate.xml.

4.
In core.test's RenameInvolvingResourceTest.java, a few typos were fixed in some
comments, and an unused member variable was removed.

5. 
In als.oal's function_import.sql, Greg increased the ID's of certain functions
to make them no longer clash with the ID's of the new operations introduced
into the ooaofooa for this issue.

6.
The actionFilter() operations of State Machine State and Transition were 
modified to take polymorphic events into account.
