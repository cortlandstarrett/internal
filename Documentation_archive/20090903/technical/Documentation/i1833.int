Tiger Project Implementation Note

Abstract

The names of the BridgePoint products are changing.  The new names are described

the user must be modified to use the new names.  This project will address

     Document that describes the new names for the BridgePoint products.

Background
----------

Please see Abstract section.

Design
------

The GettingStartedAction class deals with the BridgePoint, MC-3020, and EDGE
wizards to create a MicrowaveOven project.  Because of the change in the name
of the "Nucleus EDGE Builder" to "EDGE Builder" a list in the class must be
updated appropriately.  

Also, during the investigation of this project, it was discovered there was
an instance of where the class should notify the MC-3020 listener and it was
not.  An update listener call is added.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Updated the Test_Readme.txt in bp.welcome.test to specify running with the
external test plugin in order to test the change needed on account of the
new name for the EDGE builder.

Unit Test
---------

_- Run the bp.welcome.test unit test.
R  The bp.welcome.test unit test runs successfully.
