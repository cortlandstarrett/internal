Background
----------
ODMS is not removed from the sample models.  The OAL however is being removed 
from the metamodel in order to protect our intellectual property.

All functions and external entities are removed--the functions and external
entities packages are deleted.

All operations from all the classes are removed.

The following datatypes are removed as they are enumerations that were defined
to support the OAL:
  Multiplicity
  Justification
  Style
  End
  ParseStatus
  Scope
  
The model is named as metamodel.mdl and placed in the bp.pkg/sample-models
directory.
