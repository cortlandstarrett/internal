Tiger Implementation Note
Allow sample MicrowaveOven project to build without error

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes necessary for allowing the sample MicrowaveOven
project to build without error when a user does not have a 3020 license.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Issue 1014
[2] Testtrack issue 43

Background
----------
The welcome plugin contains a zip file which has pre-compiled object files for
the MicrowaveOven project.  These files were created with a version of EDGE
which appended numbers to the object file names.  EDGE has since fixed this
causing the MicrowaveOven to give link errors during a build where the
pre-compiled object files exist.

Design
------
1. Remove object files from welcome zip file

The object files should never be included with the project, only the source.
This allows the EDGE compiler to create the object files as needed.

All contents under the Debug/Mingw GNU Objects folder in the zip file are
removed.

2. Update the plugin versions

As a result of this change the following plugins must have their version
increased:

com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg-feature
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg-feature
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome

All necessary changes are made to increase the versions.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

The bp.doc plugin did not actually need its revision updated as the
bp_relnotes.txt file should not live there.

Unit Test
---------
_- Run tiger (without a 3020 license)
_- Complete Getting Started through welcome page
_- Open the Resource Navigator and expand MicrowaveOven/Debug
_R The Mingw GNU Objects folder does not contain any object files
