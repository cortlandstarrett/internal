Tiger Implementation Note
Add support for evaluation customers without a 3020 license.

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation of Getting Started support for evaluation
customers without a 3020 license.

History

Document References

[1] Issue 948

Background
----------
See [2]

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
It was noticed that the create_tiger_release.sh script needed to be modified to
not copy the old md-samples folder, but instead copy the new
project_contents.zip file.  The changes are made to create_tiger_release.sh.

A NPE was occuring when going through the Getting Started from a perspective
other than the xtUML Modeling perspective.  This only happened when the welcome
page was not opened in the xtUML Modeling perspective, but instead opened in
another perspective.  The closeWelcomePage method is changed to check if the
welcome screen is displayed in the xtUML Modeling perspective before trying to
close it.

The createNewDomain method used the new domain wizard to create the sample
project's domain.  This caused rough behavior as a progress monitor was
displayed from nowhere.  The method is changed to copy the model file into the
models directory and let the xtUML listeners pick up the changes.
