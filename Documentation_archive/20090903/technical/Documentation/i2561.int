Tiger Project Implementation Note
Bad single file models


Abstract
--------
Some of the single file models we currently have in CVS have relocatables
enabled.  This is invalid for our current release.

History

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bug 2561.  http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2561

Background
----------
The relocatables functionality has been put off until a future version of
BridgePoint.  However, some of the sample models we distribute had the
relocatable tags in them, which caused obvious problems for the user.  These
files need to be identified and switched back to non-relocatable versions of the
models.

Design
------
5.1     Identify which models need to change.
5.1.1   grep for the string "#@!:" (relocateable tag).  The following is the
        list of models in our installation.  They are marked OK or bad
        based on the grep returning if the model contained the tag or not:

        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core_1.4.0/models/default.xtuml (OK)
        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020_1.4.0/mc3020/models/mcc.xtuml (OK)
        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg_1.4.0/sample-models/metamodel.xtuml (OK)
        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg_1.4.0/sample-models/odms.xtuml (bad)
        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome_1.4.0/models/MicrowaveOven.xtuml (bad)
        .../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome_1.4.0/models/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome.xtuml (OK)

5.2     Fix the models
5.2.1   Run the strip_reloc.pl script (in branch MV-ALPHA-02 of
        bp.core/tools/build) on the bad files.
5.2.2   Put the new files in CVS
5.2.3   Provide the stripped files to Garry Bales for incorporation in release
        1.4.0.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
6. None.

Unit Test
---------
7.1     Grep the stripped files for the relocatable tag, verify no hits
7.2     Create a new xtUML project and import each model into it.  Verify BP has
        no trouble loading the new model.
