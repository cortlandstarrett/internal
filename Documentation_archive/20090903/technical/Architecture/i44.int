Tiger Project Implementation Note
Remove capitalization from file names

Abstract
--------
We describe the changes to file names that make them consistent
with their usage (remove capital letters).

History
-------

final i44-080403-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------

Bugzilla issue 44

Background
----------

There are files in MC-Java that have capital letters in 
their names.  References to the files are not capitalized.
This causes problems on platforms (Sol2) that are case
sensitive.  

Design
------

There are no design changes.

Work Required
-------------

i44.1  Fragment.arc

The file is renamed to fragment.inc.  The file is referenced 
in the following files:

com.projtech.bp.als/arc/ooa_oal_pop_func.arc

TinyJava/README.TXT

Keyword substitution also must be enabled for this file.

i44.2 Includes.inc

The file is renamed to translate_oal.inc.  The file is referenced 
in the following files:

Keyword substitution also must be enabled for this file.

i44.3 Java.arc

The file is renamed to java.arc.  The file is referenced 
in the following files:

TinyJava/README.TXT

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- In com.projtech.bp.core/generate.bat changed Java.arc to java.arc
- In enum3/generate.bat changed Java.arc to java.arc

Unit Test
---------

- Build core
R Generates and compiles with no errors
- Build OAL validation
