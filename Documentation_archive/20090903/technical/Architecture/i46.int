Tiger Project Implementation Note
Navigation function Fan-in.

Abstract
--------
This note describes a change to the navigation functions so that
generated code is reused and database hits are always made correctly.

History
-------
 final - i46-071003-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
Bugzilla issue 46

Background
----------
If a navigation is done where the starting instance (argument target) is
singleton and the result is many, the code body does not check the
database for instances, so instances in memory are returned, but ones
not yet loaded are missed.

Design
------
i46.1  Modify the function getMany<key_lett>sonR<rel_numb>(<instance_arg>)
       so that it constructs an array with one instance and delegates the
       call to the getMany<key_lett>sonR<rel_numb>(<array_arg>). This is
       required two places; one in RGO.arc and one in RTO.arc.
       

Work Required
-------------
i46.1.1  Make the indicated change to RGO.arc.
i46.1.2  Make the indicated change to RTO.arc.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
x- Generate code that executes a one to many navigation.
x- Run the code against a database that contains instances
   but where there are no in-memory  instances already loaded
   for some other reason.
xR The correct instance set from the database is instantiated
   and returned.
