MC-Java Implementation Note
Add prefix to attribute names

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes to MC-Java to change
the name of member variables.

History
-------

final i54-071603-01.rvm

Bugzilla issue 54

Background
----------

Attribute names are currently translated to member data
that has the same name as the attribute.  This causes
problems when the attribute name is a Java reserved word.

Design
------

i50.1  The generated attribute name is changed to prefix
the name with an 'm_'.

Work Required
-------------

i50.1 Add prefix to attribute name

i50.1.1  The function get_attribute_name is added to
the file arch_names.inc.  The attribute name has the 
form m_$l_{attribute.Name}.

i50.1.2  All places in Java.arc where the attribute names are 
currently hard-coded are changed to invoke get_attribute_name,
and the result is used.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The function get_attribute_accessor is added to 
the file arch_names.inc.  The return value is 
get$cr{attribute.Name}.  All places where the value
is hard-coded is changed to use the function.  The
files changed are: Java.arc, referred_to.inc, referring.inc.

- The function get_attribute_accessor_from_str is
added to the file arch_names.inc.  The return value is
get$cr{str}.  All places where the value
is hard-coded is changed to use the function.  The
files changed are Value.arc and create_label_provider.inc.

- The function get_test_class_name is
added to the file arch_names.inc.  The return value is
$cr{object.Name}_test_c.  All places where the value
is hard-coded is changed to use the function.  The
files changed are Java.arc and statement.arc. An
unneeded cast was removed from statement.arc as well.

- The function get_ee_class_name_from_str is
added to the file arch_names.inc.  The return value is
$Cr{str}_c.  All places where the value
is hard-coded is changed to use the function.  The
only file that changed was Value.arc. 

- The function get_ee_class_name is
added to the file arch_names.inc.  The return value is
$Cr{ee.Key_Lett}_c.  All places where the value
is hard-coded is changed to use the function.  The
only file that changed was Java.arc. 

- The function get_class_name is used everywhere the
value was previously hard-coded.  The files changed are:
Java.arc, referred_to.inc, referring.inc, statement.arc, 
Value.arc, create_explorer_view.inc.

- The function get_nav_func_name is changed so that 
it doesn't put a '(' at the end of the name. The
file parse_chain.inc was changed to account for this
in two places. 

- The function get_nav_func_name is used everywhere
the value was previously hard-coded.  The files changed
are: referred_to.inc, referring.inc, statement.arc

- The function get_sql_attribute_name is added to
the file sql_names.inc.  The attribute name has the 
form $_{attribute.Name}.  All places where the value
is hard-coded are changed to use the function. The files
changed are: Java.arc, referred_to.inc, referring.inc,
and pg_schema_gen.arc.

- The function get_sql_table_name is added to
the file sql_names.inc.  The attribute name has the 
form $_{object.Key_Lett}.  All places where the value
is hard-coded are changed to use the function. The files
changed are: Java.arc, referred_to.inc, referring.inc,
and pg_schema_gen.arc.

- The function get_sql_id_table_name is added to
the file sql_names.inc.  The attribute name has the 
form $U_{domain.Name}.  All places where the value
is hard-coded are changed to use the function. The files
changed are: Java.arc and pg_schema_gen.arc.

- The function get_sql_id_column_name is added to
the file sql_names.inc.  The attribute name has the 
form $Cr{object.Name}UniqueId.  All places where the value
is hard-coded are changed to use the function. The files
changed are: Java.arc and pg_schema_gen.arc.

- In pg_schema_gen.arc, added the .include for sql_names.inc,
and the code to get the value of PTC_MC_ARC_DIR.

- In Java.arc, added the .include for sql_names.inc.

- In Java.arc, I changed the root_class name to only be
defined once.

- In Java.arc, fixed a spelling error: "ecountered" -> "encountered"
  line 390.
  
- Added .include arch_names.inc to validate_gen.arc
