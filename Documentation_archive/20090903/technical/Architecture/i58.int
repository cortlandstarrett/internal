Tiger Project Implementation Note
Referential string not initialized

Abstract
--------
Tiny Java strings are supposed to be initialized when the enclosing
instance is created. Referntial strings do not get initialized because
their type is Same_As_Base_Attribute.

History

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 58

Design
------
Reassign type if its name is found to be <Same_As_Base_Attribute>.

Work Required
-------------
_- i58.1   - In Java.arc, when generating the constructor, if the
             type name is found to be Same_As_Base_Attribute, reassign
             the type instance handle to the result of:-

             ->O_RATTR[R106]->O_BATTR[R113]->O_ATTR[R106]->S_DT[R114]
             
             The string test following will then succeed and the 
             referential will be correctly initialized.
             
Implementation Notes
--------------------
The test and the reassignment is done after the test for unique_id
because we do not wish to consume unique ids on referentials since
they will get overwritten in due course.

Unit Test
---------
-_ Translate and execute a model with a string referential.
-_ Set a breakpoint at the constructor for the instance.
R_ After execution of the constructor, the referential string is
   set to "".
