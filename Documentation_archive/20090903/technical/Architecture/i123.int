MC-Java Implementation Note
Only declare for loop variable once

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes to MC-Java to only declare a 
for loop variable once.

History
-------

final i123-022304-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------

Bugzilla issue 123

Background
----------

The following OAL: 

select many d_set from instances of D_D;
for each d in d_set
end for;

for each d in d_set
end for;

generates code that has a syntax error, because the
d variable is declared again for the second for
statement.

Design
------

The extra declaration is due to the for statment
generation code not checking the 'is_implicit' flag
before outputting the variable declaration.

i123.1  Always check is_implicit 

The following statement generation functions must 
have a check added for is_implicit being true 
before outputting the variable declaration information:

gen_for_statement

All other statement generation functions with an 
is_implicit parameter already check the value before 
outputting the variable declaration.

Work Required
-------------

i123.1  Always check is_implicit 

In statement.inc, add the check for is_implicit being 
true to the functions listed in the design.

Implementation Comments

Unit Test
---------

- Rebuild core project
R All .java files unchanged
R No compilation errors.

- Rebuild als project
R All .java files unchanged

- Translate the following code in odms2:

select many d_set from instances of D_D;
for each d in d_set
end for;

for each d in d_set
end for;

- Code generated
R Code compiles without error.
