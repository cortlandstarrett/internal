BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Domain marking files are not created for formalized components when models are

4. Background
-------------
See design note [2]

5. Design
---------
5.1 [2, 6.1] Changes to use a single-set of Domain-level marking files.
5.1.1 sys_functions.arc needed to be moved up earlier in sys.arc.
	  Otherwise, a query tried to call it before it was defined.
	  This was a bug detected by a model that used methods defined in
	  sys_functions.arc.
5.1.2 Made marking functions backwards compatible.  Did this by leaving the
	  existing Tag* marking function entry points.  These entry points call
	  new entry points beginning with Mark*.  The Mark* entry points now
	  expect a string domain name as their first argument.  The old entry
	  points get this domain name by selecting the te_dom that is marked as
	  currently_active.
5.1.3 Modified xtulmc_build to allow processing of both old-style and new-style
      marking files.
5.1.3.1 Removed xtumlmc_dom_init, ROX_InstallLeafNode, and 
      ROX_InstallDomainColorTemplates.
5.1.3.2 Modifed the model pre-processing to leave the ".sql" produced by the 
      mc3020 plugin alone and make modifications only to the "_system.sql"
5.1.3.3 If there is more then one model file on the command-line give an error
5.1.3.4 Removed $tempSNGLfile variable that was no longer being used
5.1.3.5 Copy the single-file marking files into the code_generation folder.  If
      domain-level marking files are present then we currently copy them into 
      the code-gen folder.
5.1.3.6 Create empty marking files in the code_generation folder before 
      looking at what marking files we actually have.  After empty marking 
      files are created concatenate any existing marking files into these 
      working copies in the code_generation folder.  If they are "old-style" 
      markings that have a domain name specified then we concatenate a select 
      statement first to allow the archetype to know which domain the mark 
      applies to.  If it is a new-style marking file this select statement is 
      not needed because new-style marks specify the name of the domain to 
      associate the mark to.
5.1.3.6 Removed the relocatables substitution from xtumlmc_build.  Doing so 
        allowed the removal of a temporary file the was being used to process 
        the model.    
    
5.2 [2, 6.2] Remove the MC3020ResourceChangeListener
5.2.1 Removed MC3020ResourceChangeListener.java
5.2.2 After exporting the model the ExportBuilder calls 
	  MCBuilderArgumentHandler.setArguments() to setup the variables in the 
	  MC-3020 Model Compiler.launch file in preparation for that builder to 
	  run.
5.2.3 In ModelCompiler.java:earlyStartup() the call made to add the 
	  MC3020ResourceChangeListener to the project was removed.
5.2.4 There is code in ModelCompiler.java:earlyStartup() that checks to make 
	  sure the projects with a MC3020 nature have a prebuilder and if they do
	  not, it asks the user if they would like to update.  This code was NOT
	  removed.  There was a place in the MC3020ResourceChangeListener that 
	  made this same check, and since the MC3020ResourceChangeListener was 
	  removed it no longer exists.  This simply means if the tool is launched
	  with closed mc3020 project(s) and those project are then opened, there
	  will be no warning about a missing prebuilder.  This was discussed in the
	  design review [2].
5.3 [2, 6.3] Create all marking files during new project creation
5.3.1 Moved the default-manifest from the mc3020 plugin's manifest folder to 
	  the plugin's mc3020 folder where it is currently expected in a project.  
	  This default-manifest.xml previously existed in 2 places:
	        model_compilers/mc3020/default-manifest.xml
	        com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020/manifest/default-manifest.xml
	
	  It is used by the mc3020 plugin, but the copy used is the one that 
	  lived under the mc3020 plugin's mc3020 folder (where model compiler are).  
	  The default-manifest.xml now lives only in the mc3020 plugin's mc3020
	  folder.  The copies have been deleted.
	            
5.3.2 The domain-level marking files were moved into the "system" section of
	  the manifest and the "_" in their names was removed.  The models section 
	  of the manifest was removed.      
5.4 [2, 6.4] Modify the MC prebuilder to setup the xtumlmc_build command-line 
    arguments
5.4.1 Introduced MCBuilderArgumentandler.java to setup the MC-3020 Model 
	  Compiler.launch variables.  This includes the command-line passsed to
	  xtumlmc_build.  The Model Compiler prebuilder calls on this class to 
	  after it exports the single-file model. BridgePoint sequences the 
	  builders in the .project files so the prebuilder always runs first.
5.5 [2, 6.5] Leave both builders (prebuilder and MC3020 builder) in place
    No action to take.
         
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 During testing an observation was made that modifying the MC3020 arc folder
    did not cause the xtumlmc_build licensing parameter to change as expected. 
    Since the prebuilder now completely controls the command line it should 
    have changed. 
6.1.1 Investigation determined the license check was being done during the
    Model Compiler plugin's initial startup, and the licensing string was being
    cached at that time and not checked again.  
6.1.2 When the license check was implemented, there was not prebuilder and 
    therefore the only reasonable place to check the license was at startup.
    In the prior versions, this meant that a customer switching from source
    to binary license had modify their project and their restart the tool to
    make the switch from binary to source MC (or visa-versa).
6.1.3 The license string cache has been removed and the license is now 
    checked by the prebuilder at the time the xtumlmc_build command-line is
    setup.
6.1.4 The BridgePointLicenseManager was modified to allow checking of the 
    MC licenses.  The logic in it was simplified.  Given a license to check
    it checks the given license first, and for some license (system licenses)
    it checks a second and in some case a third license if the first one(s)
    are not available.
6.2 Fixed a bug with events being passed to timers causing a compiler
    warning.  Added the needed cast.
