BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Prevent null ids SQL tables

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes a solution to a problem where a null id value was being
output for an O_REF instance.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 3303
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3303

4. Background
-------------
If a user exports a model which contains an association between a class and an
imported class, there is a possibility that the referential attribute has not
been loaded at the time of writing the SQL table.  This allows for a null id
value to get output and in turn causes the model to become corrupt.

5. Design
---------
5.1 Output cached id value if association to referential value is not setup

As the background states there is a possibility for a null id value to get
output in a SQL file.  This is because the referential which holds the actual id
value has not been loaded at the time of export.  MC-Java currently generates
the getter methods for ids such that the cached instance (the referred to
instance) is checked for the id, if the cached instance has not been setup yet
the code will simply return a null id.

MC-Java is changed to generate the getter methods such that the cached id (the
value from file) is used if the cached instance is not already setup.  Careful
consideration was made when making this design choice, to the best of our
knowledge it is impossible for the cached id value to become stale.  This allows
for a solution that will always work.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
_- Run all existing j-unit tests
_R All tests pass

_- Check out bp.core
_- Restart the tool
_- Select the project and Export > xtUML Model
_- Uncheck everything but the ooaofooa
_- Export to a single file
_- Import to a new project
_- No O_REF instances have null ids where a valid id should be present
   The following query (in eclipse search with regular expressions) can locate
   a null id:
     INSERT INTO O_REF.*\n.*VALUES.*\n.*"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
