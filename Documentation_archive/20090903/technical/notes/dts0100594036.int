BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Introduce MC3020 AUTOSAR changes for the SeatHeater demo.

1. Abstract

Update MC-3020 to support Sender/Receiver and Client/Server communication
schemes.

4. Background
-------------
4.1  The VSI product provides debugging capability at an abstract (component
     model) level for AUTOSAR applications.  The product is lacking
     applications that make for compelling demos.  The SeatHeater application
     has been developed and documented as a compelling, real-world application
     for AUTOSAR.  However, we do not have SeatHeater application software
     that runs in an AUTOSAR environment.
4.2  Rather than compose a C application by hand, we will build a BridgePoint
     xtUML model of SeatHeater.  We will test this model in Verifier and in
     compiled C generated from MC-3020.  We will then modify MC-3020 to
     generate a legitimate AUTOSAR application that can be integrated with
     the ETAS RTE and OSEK RTOS.
4.3  There are two time-frames that affect MC-3020 AUTOSAR development.  In
     longer term (1-3 months)[2], we will develop a fully AUTOSAR compliant C
     code generator.  However, in the short term (2 weeks), we will build a
     C code generator that runs sufficiently for SeatHeater demo purposes.

5. Design
---------
5.1 For the short-term Timers will not be directly replaced or integrated with
    RTE timer methods.
5.2 With respect to the current phase SeatHeater demo, it was chosen to maintain
	separate RTE timer calls for each Software Component.  This timer call will
	be responsible for event queue interrogation.
5.3 Two communication schemes are to be supported by the MC-3020; Sender/
	Receiver and Client/Server. Port signals are handled using Sender/Receiver
	communication and port operations are handled using Client/Server
	communication.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 To introduce changes to support per software component timer calls,
	a separate timer function was generated in each software components ports'
	file.
6.2 Ports support both signals and operations. To handle port operations,
	synchronous client/server communications is adopted. According to the port
	direction, a client port initiates an RTE call and waits for the server
	port to perform the service required.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 To test the timer and client/server MC3020 modifications, code was generated
	for	the SeatHeater model to check that the code supports the necessary
	functionalities.
	_- Create an xtUML project with the SeatHeater model
	(svn:tenmile Models/Demo/SeatHeater)
	_- Build the project
	_R The generated ports C files contains the timer functions to be called by
	the RTE
	_R The generated ports C files contains the required client/server RTE
	interfaces for port operations
	
7.2 The generated files should be executed in a VSI environment
