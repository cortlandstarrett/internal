BridgePoint Project Design Note
ClassLoader modifications needed for Eclipse 3.3

1. Abstract
-----------
The BridgePoint class loader needs to be modified in order to work with 
Eclipse 3.3.  This note will describe why the modification is needed and
what the modification is.

    Note: This issue's design note summarizes the issue as: "Add a BridgePoint 
    External Class Loader to Model Verifier".  This is the issue where that
    BPClassLoader was introduced.

    Replace monolithic EclipseAdaptor implementation with a hookable adaptor.
    Note: It was during this issue that the EclipseClassLoader was refactored.
    It is this work that is causing us to refactor BPClassLoader.

        
4. Background
-------------
While updating BridgePoint from Eclipse 3.1.2 to 3.3.1.1 [2] the implementation 
approach taken was to work through each of the syntax, compile, 
and runtime errors found and fix them as they were encountered.  This worked 
well for almost all of the issues encountered because most the issues were 
fairly trivial.  This issue was broken-out when it was investigated 
and determined to not be as trivial as the others. 

5. Analysis
-----------
The goal of this issue is the same as the goal of bug 1845 [2], which is to 
migrate from Eclipse 3.1 to Eclipse 3.3 with as little impact on the code base 
as possible.  However, since this issue has been broken-out from the main
Eclipse migration issue an additional goal is to simplify the BPClassLoader if
possible.

6. Design
---------
The problem lies in class that the BPClassLoader extends (EclipseClassLoader).  
BPClassLoader was introduced with the BridePoint Model Verifier [3].  It's 
purpose is to allow MV to make use of a realized class supplied by the user or 
internally by Mentor Graphics [4 5].  This class was implemented by extending 
class org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseClassLoader which in turn extended
class org.eclipse.osgi.framework.adaptor.core.DefaultClassLoader.  With the 
release of Eclipse 3.2, one of the changes made caused the 
org.eclipse.osgi.framework.adaptor package to be refactored [6].  Part of the 
confusion which caused this issue to have to been broken-out was that this
change was not well documented.  Investigation has determined:
- This change is not mentioned in the Eclipse 3.2 or Eclipse 3.3 migration 
  guides.  
- While the EclipseClassLoader is defined in org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor,
  the org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor package is actually defined 
  in the org.eclipse.osgi plugin.  In the Eclipse source tree, it is under
  org.eclipse.osgi/eclipseAdapter/arc/org/eclipse/runtime/adaptor.  This made 
  the change hard to find. 
- The class was simply removed from the class hierarchy in Eclipse 3.2 by 
  issue 114968 [6], which made it hard to find.

6.1 Refactor BPClassLoader as needed to conform to the changes specified by
    the Eclipse bug that removed 
    org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseClassloader [6].
6.1.1 Note that the majority of the implementation of the old EclipseClassLoader
    can now be found in 
    org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseClassLoadingHook.  To 
    refactor BPClassLoader we can find the places where EclipseClassLoadingHook
    is being used and use them as a guide.
    
7. Design Comments
------------------
None

8. Work Required
----------------
See the Design section above.

9. Unit Test
------------
All existing unit tests pass (especially com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test).
