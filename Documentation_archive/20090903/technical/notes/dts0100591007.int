4. Background

5. Design

See[2].

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 Core
As [2,6.1], except all operations are named dissatisfy as opposed to unsatisfy
as specified. Also each of the four classes specified in the design have an
additional operation, getSatisfactionCount added to support the auto-
reconciliation infrastructure (see 6.2).

6.2 Canvas
As [2, 6.3], except the listener class specified is implemented using the canvas
auto-reconcile feature.

6.2.1 Additional canvas plugin entries are added to tell the reconciler to check
the graphics for Requirement and Imported Requirement classes. The count method
is specified as getSatisfactionsCount. The other methods are marked as
'not used' to make it clear that they are not needed for connectors.

6.2.2 The canvas Auto Reconciliation Specification class is modified to
reconcile connector ends. This is implemented by comparing the satisfaction
count obtained through the auto reconciliation extension point with the number
of anchors (GraphConnector) instances found attached to the graphic element.

It was found to be simpler to only reconcile requirement connectors, since they
are only zero or one cardinality. Even if the Provision is clicked on to perform
the dissatisfaction feature, the partner Requirements are all polled and the
correct graphical connections removed. This avoids the complexity of
identifying which anchor of a one to many set to remove. It also avoids the
performance overhead of needlessly checking the same connector twice, once from
the perspective of the Provision and once from the perspective of the
Requirement.

7. Unit Test
------------
During the implementation process it was discovered that a different code path
(indeed a different graphics metamodel navigation) is required depending on
whether the Requirement is dropped on the Provision or vice versa. Accordingly
separate tests are devised that exercise both permutations.

The degrees of freedom are therefore:

- Provision dropped on Requirement (versus dropped on Provision)
- Requirement side is dissatisfied (versus Provision side)
- 2 connectors joined (3 connectors joined)
- Local Provision (versus Imported Provision)
- Local Requirement (versus Imported Requirement)

Outcomes (O):

0 - All connectors disconnected.
1 - One connector still connected.

- In the case of expected outcome 0, test that all connector ends (2 or 3
  depending on the test) can be independently moved after the Dissatisfy is
  performed.
- In the case of expected outcome 1, test that the correct connector is free to
  move independently and that the other is still attached to the partner
  connector.
- For all tests, after the Dissatisfy, show that a disconnected connector can be
  reconnected to the same partner connector and to a different partner
  connector.
