BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Datatype Marking and Other Fixes

1. Abstract
-----------
Data type marking has been partly bypassed since the move to OAL instance -based
translation.  This issue will re-enable these marking capabilities.

2. History
----------

3. Document References

    return values and attributes.

4. Background
-------------
A model of marking subsystem was added to the model compiler meta-model in a 
previous release cycle.  Only two classes were added to introduce and prove the
concept (TM_SYNC and TM_DOM).

The model of marking allows marking to occur before the query/populate stage
of translation begins.  This is because a model of marking allows marking to
simply create instances of marking classes and populate their attribute values.
There is no dependence upon preexisting instances of Translation Extensions
classes.

When the query/populate stage of translation occurs, it can query the model of
marking and adjust translation based upon what it finds.

See [3] for background on what these markings do and how to use them.

5. Design
---------
5.1      Enhance Model of Marking for Datatypes
5.1.1    Add the following classes to the Translation Marking subsystem of the
         MC-3020 metamodel.
5.1.1.1  Data Type Pointer (TM_POINTER)
5.1.1.2  Data Type Precision (TM_PRECISION)
5.1.1.3  Enumeration Uninit (TM_ENUMINIT)
5.1.1.4  Enumerator Value (TM_ENUMVAL)
5.2      Change marking functions to create instances of the above classes
         rather than searching for instances of extension classes.
5.3      Modify the query/populate queries to fold in the marks supplied
         through the instances of the marking model.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1.    Made a change in the way the Action_Semantics attribute is stored for
        DocGen.  The change reduces the amount of memory used by DocGen and any
        model-based model compiler.
        Most of string handling in MC-3020 is done with fixed length arrays
        of characters.  However, dynamic memory allocation is present in
        MC-3020 and enabled for model compilers (including DocGen).
        Since Action_Semantics strings can be very long and of different
        lengths, it makes sense to allocation them from the heap rather
        than using the fixed string length approach.
6.2.    Found a bug in synchronous operations between components when data is
        returned from the operation that is satisfied across an interface.
        The OAL was being generated into the action and should not be.
6.3.    Enhanced the way events are marked as used.  We now mark them used
        even if they are not generated but are accessed in OAL.
6.4.    Removed cruft from the MC-3020-HEAD version of bp.core.  There was a
        lot of data in folders that has little to do with the model itself.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1.     Check out or create a model that runs.  (e.g. RATR [2])
7.2.     Run baseline model.
         _- Check out [2].
         _- Create myticudt, myticudtr (of real) and myticedt at the domain
            level.
         _- Create systemudti, systemudtr (of real) and systemedt at the
            system level.
         _- Build with mc3020.
         _R See no red in Console.
         _R Obtain cleanly compiled executable.
         _- Run.
         _R See lots of tracing output.
         _- Interrupt exit.
7.3.     Run model with data type marks.
         _- Check out [2].
         _- Mark data types with the following (assuming domain "tic"):
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "tic", "myticudt", "unsigned long", "0" )
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "tic", "myticudtr", "double", "0.0" )
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "tic", "myticedt", "uchar_t", "0" )
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "*", "systemudti", "unsigned long", "0" )
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "", "systemudtr", "double", "0.0" )
         .invoke TagDataTypePrecision( "*", "systemedt", "uchar_t", "0" )
         .//
         .invoke MapDataTypeAsPointer( "*", "myticudt", "long", "0" )
         .invoke MapDataTypeAsPointer( "*", "systemudti", "void", "0" )
         .//
         .invoke TagEnumeratorDiscreteValue( "tic", "myticedt", "d1", "7" )
         .invoke TagEnumeratorDiscreteValue( "", "systemedt", "e2", "3" )
         .//
         .invoke TagUninitializedEnumerationValue( "*", "myticedt", "9" )
         .invoke TagUninitializedEnumerationValue( "*", "systemedt", "20" )
         _- Build with mc3020.
         _R See no red in Console.
         _R Obtain cleanly compiled executable.
         _R Inspect sys_types.h and see type changes.
         _R Inspect <domain>_datatypes.h and see type changes.
         _- Run.
         _R See lots of tracing output.
         _- Interrupt exit.
