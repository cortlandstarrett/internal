Renaming DataType package invalidates DataType references
Impossible to open an unnamed and persisted package

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes bug fixes for renaming data type packages [1], persisting 
empty "container" packages [2], and issues found during unit test cleanup 
following a release [3].

4. Background
-------------
none

5. Design
---------
5.1 Renaming DataType package invalidates DataType references [1]
5.1.1  In ModelExportPage.java:selectReferredToElements() a section was added to 
    check for dependencies  when the selected element is a container package 
    (Package_c).  Dependent elements are now automatically selected when a 
    Package_c that refers to them is selected.  We were previously not doing 
    this which means we would allow invalid models to be exported in the case 
    where a Package_c was selected, but referred-to element inside the 
    selected Package_c were not selected.
5.1.2 In checkNestedDataTypePackagesForReferences(DataTypePackage_c, 
	NonRootModelElement) account for the fact that the given DataTypePackage 
	may be in a Package_c.  This fixes a ClassCastException in the export 
	wizard.  This exception was hit when EP_PKGs that contained S_DPKs were 
	selected/deselected in the export wizard.
	
5.2 Impossible to open an unnamed and persisted package [2]
	In callFireMethod(Runnable) the 2 places where the Runnable was executed 
	on the display thread were changed from asynchronous execution to 
	synchronous execution.  This fixes a persistence race condition.  The 
	problem was that this routine is called to invoke the resource change 
	listeners after a model change, and  if the listeners do not get a chance 
	to run before  persistence occurs then then an incomplete model may be 
	persisted.

	An example of this occurs when a new model element is  added to a System 
	package diagram.  When the element is created, it is added to the default 
	model root (PersistableModelComponent.setComponent()) and then the canvas 
	model listener is invoked to update the graphical  elements model root 
	(CanvasModelListener.modelRootChanged()).  Before this fix, what was 
	happening is that the CanvasModelListener was invoked asyncronously, 
	therefore it was simply dumb luck if the modelroot change ran before 
	persistence.  If the model root change did not happen before persistence 
	then the graphics were not persisted.

5.3 Verifier JUnit test suite updates [3]
    - Update expected results to account for changes to element ordering and 
      new attributes that have been added over the last few BridgePoint 
      versions.
    - Split the io.mdl.test/IOMdlTestSuite into 2 parts to workaround 
      test errors caused by conflicting static initializations that happen when
      the test suite is instantiated.    
    
5.4 Verifier JUnit test suite updates [4]
    Have VerifierTest extend BaseTest so we pickup the logging that we get from 
    BPTest/TestResultLogger.java
    
	Require the bp.test plugin because it extends the 
	"org.eclipse.jdt.junit.testRunListeners"extension point with the 
	bp/test/TestResultLogger.java class to provide us with a result log.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 Removed the xtuml nature from the mc3020.test project.  This xtuml nature 
    is not needed in this project, and the project does not have the supporting 
    folders/files that a project with an xtuml nature should have which causes 
    error log entries when threads run that make assumptions about the fact 
    that a project with an xtuml nature should have these files/folders.


7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Verify that issue 3909 [1] is resolved.
    _- Create a new project (i3909)
    _- Open the System Model Package Diagram
    _- Add a new Container Package (Testcontainer_package1)
    _- Open Testcontainer_package1
    _- Create a new Data Type Package (Testdata_type_package) in
		Testcontainer_package1
    _- Add a new UDT in Testdata_type_package (TestIntDataType) and make it an 
       integer
    _- Open the System Model Package Diagram
    _- Add a new Container Package (Testcontainer_package2)
    _- Open Testcontainer_package2
    _- Create a new Interface Pacakge (Testdata_interface_package)
    _- Create a new Interface in Testdata_interface_package (Testinterface)
    _- Add a new signal to Testinterface (Testsignal)
    _- Add a parameter (TestIntParam) to TestSignal of type TestIntDataType
    _- Restart the tool
    _- Rename Testdata_type_package to Testdata_type_packageRenamed
    _R No problems are displayed in the problem view
    _- Open Testdata_interface_package in Me and select the TestIntParam 
       parameter of the Testsignal signal
    _R Is of type TestIntDataType as expected
    
7.1.1 
    _- Using the model created in the previous step, export/import the model 
       and select/deselect the dependant container package while doing so.
    _R No NPE is encountered
   
      

7.2 Verify that new "container" pacakges are properly persisted.
    _- Create the following elements in a system package diagram
			Package_c
			DataTypePackage_c
			ComponentPacakge
			InterfacePackage
			SequenceDiagram
			CommunicationDiagram
			UseCase diagram
			ActivityDiagram	   
	_- restart 
	_- Open the editors of the created elements
	_R The editors open successfully

Revision 1.3  2008/11/26 15:57:22  rmulvey
Job:4034
Removed the fix for bug 4034 from this branch.  It requires a change to
io.core/export_functions.inc that is not a small enough change to squeeze into another branches
promotion.  The modification that needs to be made is to modify the change made during revision
1.18.2.1 of io.core/export_functions.inc to add a check to make sure we are not performing a
single-file export when the generated RGO export methods are called during RTO export and
during the S_DT special-case exporting.

Revision 1.1  2008/11/26 15:31:51  rmulvey

Added the fix for bug 4034 to this branch.
