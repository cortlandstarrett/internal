BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Remove timing window in verifier

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to remove a race condition where the
target of an event is not set up until after the event queue has been unlocked.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------

    Policy covering relate of already related instances requires review.
[3] ClearQuest DEI dts0100565196
    Incorrect event queue shown when using component execution

4. Background
-------------
Reports were made of frequent cases where no target for event errors were being
reported during Verifier runtime. This was traced to a number of places in the
operation Pending Event.fireToClassSM(). In this operation, the last line:

// Make this event pending for the target class
relate self to target_cie across R2931;

always happens after the calls to Execution Engine.unlockQueue(queue_name).

Thus a window exists where another thread can start before the target class has
been set up. If this thread is the execution engine execution thread for the
receiving component, it attempts to process the event and logs the error. It
also disposes the event so that it is lost and the thread of control is thus
compromised.

Although the window looks small, it was leading to relatively frequent errors
(> 1 in 10,000).

5. Design
---------
Move the relate statements into the body of the operation before the queues are
released. This change is required in two places in fireToClassSM(), just before
the unlockQueue() calls. Note there are 3 calls to unlockQueue() in the
operation. In the case where no target class is found, setting up the target
cannot be performed so no relate statement is needed.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 The instance fireToInstSM() operation cannot fail because there is currently no
way for an instance based event to be delivered on a separate thread. However,
the operation, Pending Event.fireToInstSM() is given similar treatment for
consistency and robustness for future enhancements.

6.2 Added a change to help debug verifier problems.  This was called out
    in dts0100580091 [2].
Useful in catching this problem [2] was a catch clause added in the 
BPThread.startModel() method:

inside the while block in the runner thread inner class, right after the 'try' 
clause and before the 'finally', I added:

 		          catch (Exception e) {
		        	  DebugUIPlugin.log(e);
		          }

This gets runtime errors put into the error log properly and it provides a good 
place to put a breakpoint too.

So (+ is added) :

		          try {
		        	  ModelRoot.disableChangeNotification();
                                 // runtime execution code . . . 
		          }
+		          catch (Exception e) {
+		        	  DebugUIPlugin.log(e);
+		          }
		          finally {
		        	  ModelRoot.enableChangeNotification();
		          }

6.3 A 2-line fix for a problem causing incorrect event queue to be shown when 
    using component execution [3] is included in this promotion.

In com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.BPThread.getStackFrames() uses the following 
line to obtain the list of outstanding timer events:

// Timer events
PendingEvent_c [] tes = PendingEvent_c.getManyI_EVIsOnR2940(Timer_c.TimerInstances(engine.getModelRoot()));

The above selects all timers globally, when it should only select those for the 
component that the current BPThread represents. This is rather done thus:
 
 // Timer events
Timer_c [] timers = Timer_c.getManyI_TIMsOnR2940(PendingEvent_c.getManyI_EVIsOnR2964(engine));
PendingEvent_c [] tes = PendingEvent_c.getManyI_EVIsOnR2940(timers);
 

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 All existing unit tests must pass.

7.2 Run Seat Heater for 2 or more hours, observe that no target not found errors
are reported.

Updated the note to account for 2 small changes (for other issues) added during promotion.They are:
ClearQuest DEI dts0100580091
    Policy covering relate of already related instances requires review.  Actually, what was addwed was a
	log message for a situation where verifier was throwing an exception.  This log message was very helpful
    in finding this issue (the issue itself will remain open).
