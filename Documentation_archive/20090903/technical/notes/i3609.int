BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
PEIs Reborn

1. Abstract
-----------
"Preexisting Instances Defined in Data" has been a feature in MC-3020 for many
years.  However, it has fallen into disrepair with the demise of the Model
Debugger.  It shall be reborn with the Model Verifier.  This will provide all
of the previous capability in a much more integrated and clean user interface.
This issue will address the MC-3020 requirements for PEIs.  Issue [3] will
be used to track the changes to BridgePoint proper.

2. History
----------
None.

4. Background
-------------
Read [5] for an overview, history and background theory of this
functionality.

5. Design
---------
None.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
I found two (non-fatal) bugs during testing of this issue.  The first I found
in bridge.arc, because I manually ran a test in a configuration that uses
funky bridge objects (FBOs).  It hit a typo.  The second error was found
due to a coloring test (for CollectionsFlavor) that had not been upgraded to
the new meta-model.

dogs.xtuml was imported, a component package with component named "dogs" was
created. When attempting to run setup function this error appeared:
"User invoked function: setup failed, no statements to execute. Check for 
OAL problems"
The model was parsed on import. This solved the problem. [4]

7. Unit Test
------------
See Design note [3] section 9.
Note: these tests were done with the upgraded models found in [6]
