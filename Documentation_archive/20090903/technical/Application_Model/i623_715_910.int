Tiger Implementation Note
Miscellaneous Metamodel Fixes

Abstract
--------
This note describes minor changes to the metamodel in areas currently not used.

History

Issue 715
Issue 910

Background
----------
Issue 623 describes an incorrectly drawn relationship.

Issue 715 describes incorrect cardinalities in the metamodel.

Issue 910 describes a data error in the Scope data type.

Design
------

1. Issue 623 change

The issue states:

"The selection subsystem contains a relationship between a Select (ACT_SEL) 
and a Value (V_VAL) across R613.  This is incorrect as the relationship should 
be between an ACT_SEL and an V_VAR."

Actually, it is correct.  The V_VAL instance is an Instance Reference (V_IRF)
or Instance Set Reference (V_ISR) that points to the variable that is the 
start of the navigation chain. The relationship description for R613 is 
updated to describe this explictly.

The OalParserTest is changed to verify that the Value instance is a supertype
of either the Instance Reference or Instance Set Reference class.

2. Issue 715 change

The multiplicy of all classes having an association with the Variable (V_VAR)
class is examined.  Since variables can be used in multiple statements,
the multiplicity at the non-V_VAR end of the association should always be *.
The following associations were examined:

ACT_FOR  R614   - correct
ACT_FOR  R652   - correct

V_TVL    R805   - correct
V_AVL    R807   - correct
V_IRF    R808   - correct
V_ISR    R809   - correct
V_TRV    R830   - does not apply, as this specifies the variable the operation
                  will write its return value to
ACT_BLK  R823   - does not apply, as this is the scope the variable exists in

ACT_AT   R636   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_AI   R629   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_CR   R633   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_DEL  R634   - change from 1 to *, change other end from 0..1 to 1

ACT_REL  R615   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_REL  R616   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_RU   R617   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_RU   R618   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_RU   R619   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_UNR  R620   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_UNR  R621   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_URU  R622   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_URU  R623   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_URU  R624   - change from 0..1 to *           
     
ACT_SEL  R638   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_FIO  R639   - change from 0..1 to *                
ACT_FIW  R665   - change from 0..1 to *                
 
ACT_TFM  R667   - change from 0..1 to *

E_CES    R710   - change from 0..1 to *                
E_CEI    R711   - correct    
E_GEN    R712   - correct
E_GPR    R713   - change from 0..1 to *                
E_GPR    R714   - change from 0..1 to * (references an O_ATTR instance, but 
                   should be changed for the same reasons)
          

3. Issue 910 change

The value of the S_DT.Dom_ID attribute for the Scope datatype is currently zero.
It is changed (by hand editing the .xtuml file) to the correct value, 40796.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- Updated O_ATTR.dispose() and V_VAR.clear() to unrelate the changed 
relationships listed above.  The core.test dispose test now checks those 
relationships due to the changed cardinality.

Unit Test
---------
Since no new features are being introduced and the changes to the metamodel are
in areas that are currently not being used, no new unit test is required. Stable 
execution of tiger and all other unit tests are the only tests that need to 
be carried out.

- Rebuild tiger
R Tiger rebuilds without error

- Run all unit tests
R All tests pass
