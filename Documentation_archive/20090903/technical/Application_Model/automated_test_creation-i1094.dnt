Tiger Project Design Note
Automation of 2020 test model recreation

Abstract
--------
This note describes the design for recreating all of the 2020 test suite models
using the data captured in them to produce WinRunner scripts.  The WinRunner
scripts shall then reproduce the models exactly as they were.

Background
----------
See [2].

Design
------

1. Create model to define model recreation

A new model is created, ModelRecreation, to capture the different types of model
building needed to recreate the test models.  It captures a change, which can
be one of the following types:

1. Attribute Value
2. Element Creation
3. Link (Using Property View)
4. Link (Using Menu)

The Attribute Value is used to represent setting an element's attribute to a
given value.  The element creation is used to represent the creation of one of
the following types:

1. Graphical Shape (Drawing of a new shape)
2. Graphical Connector (Drawing of a new connector)
3. Element by Menu (Creating a non-graphical element from the menu)

The Link (Using Property View) is used to represent setting a value using the
Properties view that causes a link to be established.  This mainly deals with
setting data types.  The Link (Using Menu) is used to represent changing the
properties of an element using the context menu.  An example of the
representation would be for adding an attribute to an identifier. 

2. Create archetype to populate recreation model

An archetype is created which shall traverse the pre-existing instances of the
ooaofooa_hierarchy and generate an archetype that processes each instance from a
test model.  The archetype shall use the ooaofooa_hierarchy to process each test
model's elements in the correct parent child order.

For each instance that is found in the test model, an entry to a pre-existing
instances database shall be added.  The pre-existing instances will represent
instances found in the model created in section 1.  Each instance shall have all
of its attributes setup.

In order for an archetype to correctly process the pre-existing instances the
following values shall be cached:

1. Ooa_Type - Used to determine the correct tool to draw with.
2. Path - Used to correctly locate an entry in Model Explorer
3. Ge_Id - Used to link a change to a graphical element.

3. Create archetype to produce WinRunner script from recreation model

An archetype is created which shall process all of the pre-existing instances
created in section 2.  For each instance the approriate WinRunner script shall
be output.

Design Comments
---------------

Work Required
-------------

1. Create model to define model recreation

The model is created according to the design.

2. Create archetype to populate recreation model

The archetype, generate_recreation_db.arc, is created according to the design.

3. Create archetype to produce WinRunner script from recreation model

The archetype, generate_test_script.arc, is created according to the design.

Unit Test
---------

The generated WinRunner scripts shall compare the original model to the new
model structurally after each creation.  The result is there are no structural
differences.
