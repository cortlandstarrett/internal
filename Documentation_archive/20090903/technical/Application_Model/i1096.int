Tiger Implementation Note
Only add referential attribute to identifier when needed

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to only add a referential attribute to an 
identifier when it is appropriate.

History
-------

final i1096-071405-01.rvm

Document References

[2] Documentation/external/bulletins/7.0.3/i1096.dfb

Background
----------
When an attribute is added to an identifier that is used to formalize a 
relationship, the referential attributes are added to the referring class(es).
If the current existing referential attributes are part of an identifier, then
the new referential attribute is always part of the same identifier.  This
shouldn't happen for simple associations.

Design
------

1. Change identifier selection logic

In Attribute.addToIdentifier, the determination of whether the referential
attribute is part of an identifier ignores the association type.  The code is
changed to only use the identifier if the association is a link association or
a super/subtype association, since these associations require the new referential
attribute be part of the identifier.  The following changes (+) are made:

    select any ref_attr_id related by rgo->O_REF[R111]->O_RATTR[R108]->
       O_ATTR[R106]->O_OIDA[R105];
    id_id = -1;
    if ( not_empty ref_attr_id )
+     select one assoc related by rgo->R_OIR[R203]->R_REL[R201]->R_ASSOC[R206];
+     select one subsup related by rgo->R_OIR[R203]->R_REL[R201]->R_SUBSUP[R206];
+     if not_empty assoc or not_empty subsup
+       // these associations require the referentials be part of the
+       // identifier.
        id_id = ref_attr_id.Oid_ID;
+     end if;
    end if;

where rgo is an instance of Referring Class In Assoc (R_RGO) that uses the 
identifier being updated to refer to the class with the attribute being updated.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
None

Unit Test
---------

- The AttributeMenuItemTests model is updated to add a class that has
a simple relationship with a class whose identifier is changed.  The existing
referential attribute in the new class is an identifying attribute.  The change
to the model causes all expected results that use this model to be updated.
The results in expected_results/AttributeMenuItem_15 show the corrected 
behavior fixed by this work.

- Run all tests
R All tests pass
