Tiger Project Analysis Note
Generate WinRunner test Scripts

Abstract
--------
This note describes the requiremenst for generating test input to the WinRunner
test tool.

History
-------

Document References

Background
----------
Since we are recreating a lot of pre-existing models using Tiger, and since we
can recreate those models by interacting with Tiger through WinRunner, it should
be possible to generate the WinRunner scripts to carry out this task. This is
less labor intensive than redoing all the drawings and can be applied to any new
models we decide we need to create to test the model compiler.

Analysis
--------
We need to traverse each model, identify the models, shapes and connectors that
need to be drawn. For each shape and connector, we need to identify what else
needs to be set for that meta-model element to make it the same as the original
model.

- For each diagram model (GD_MD) found, starting with the Domain Package and
  working down through Class Diagrams to State Diagrams:
  - Open the diagram
  - For each shape on the diagram:
    - Select the correct tool and draw the shape at the same position and size
      as the original.
    - Traverse the test tree for the shape type and modify the values as
      specified there.
  - For each connector on the diagram    
    - Select the correct tool and draw the connector with the same waypoint
      positions as the original.
    - Traverse the test tree for the connector type and modify the values as
      specified there.

Test tree can consist of 4 types of entry:

- Attribute Value. Set the value of the specified attribute to what it was in
  the original model. For example, an Attribute Value of 'name' would cause the
  generated code to cache the value found in the original model element's name
  field (this can be cached as a literal in the generated script or read from a
  file), and write it into the name property of the newly drawn shape when
  running the script (recommend using the properties view to set all values
  rather than special casing 'Rename' in the tree).
- Traverse and Create. Traverse the specified association chain and for each
  instance found create a corresponding instance in the new model by invoking
  the specified New > menu entry (examples: attributes, operations, bridges).
- Traverse and Link (Property). Traverse the specified association chain and
  link the starting instance to the instance found at the other end by choosing
  an entry in the specified property droplist (examples: all data type
  properties).
- Traverse and Link (Menu). Traverse the specified association chain and
  link the starting instance to the instance found at the other end by choosing
  the specified menu entry (examples Add to Identifier, Formalize...). This
  entry shall link to another table that shall specify additional data for those
  wizards that require extra input.

For the extra input table, we just need entries that specify the name of the
wizard field and the value to either match with or enter depending on the
wizard.

The resulting WinRunner scripts will allow for the fact that an empty model
already contains some artifacts. It must not attempt to recreate already
existing elements and must remove elements that are present by default but which
do not appear in the original model.

Work Required
-------------
- Create a schema for the coloring data
- Hand create the data
- Create the archetypes
- Run the scripts and check the output

Acceptance Test
---------------
Compare the new WinRunner/Tiger produced models with the originals, they should
be identical to the originals, right down to the pixel.
