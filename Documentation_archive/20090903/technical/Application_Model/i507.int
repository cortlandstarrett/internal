Implementation Comments
-----------------------
Most of the deletion tests below are already automated in the core deletion
test[3]. The two cases marked * below are not. Unfortunately, the
CoreDeletionTest source is temporarily unavailable due to a hardware problem.
Equivalent tests are added instead to the Canvas editor test[4] and an issue is
raised to get them moved to[3] as soon as the source becomes available.

Unit Test
---------
_- Open ODMS
_- Open the Class Diagram
_- Right click on the subtype connector from Online Disk to Disk
_- Delete it
_R The subtype line is deleted and the Disk_ID is migrated to an identifying
   attribute of type integer.
_- Right click on the Link line between Disk Request and R1
_- Delete it
_R The link is deleted and Disk_ID and Qualified_Process_ID are migrated to
   identifying attributes of type integer.
_- Select Qualified Process class. *
_- Delete it
_R Associations R1 and R2 are removed and Disk_ID in Disk Ownership is migrated
   to an identifying attribute of type integer.
_- Select the Drive class *
_- Delete it
_R Association R5 is deleted. Drive_Disk Assignment.Drive_ID is migrated to an
   identifying attribute. Drive_Disk Assignment.Disk_ID is deleted (the subtype
   line to R7 is also removed as a by product of this test).
_- Select the Supertype connector of R7.
_- Delete it
_R The supertype line is deleted. The subtype connectors to Slot and
   Entry_Exit Port are deleted.
_- Select the association, R9.
_- Delete it.
_R The association is deleted. The referential attribute Robot.Disk_Transfer_ID
   is deleted.

_- Run all unit tests
_R All tests pass.
