Tiger Implementation Note
Hook R202 up correctly when adding subtypes.

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes needed to correctly hook up the R202 association
between an imported class and its Class in Association instance when creating a
new subtype line.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 518
[2] Bugzilla issue 679

Background
----------
The final test for moving i518 to VERIFIED[1] detected incorrect behavior with
respect to imported subtype deletion, where the subtype line would be left
on the canvas and the class that had been imported was left connected in the
association. The Imported Class dispose() operation relies on finding all the
Class in Association instances associated with it by traversing R202. The
Subsystem.newSubtype() operation failed to establish the R202 association
instance, so when the imported class dispose transaction happens any subtype
associations are not torn down.

Design
------
The Subsystem.newSubtype() operation is enhanced to establish this association
if necessary immediately after creation of the class in association instance
and its use in hooking up the Class with its Subtype/Supertype Association. The
added OAL shall be:

  if (param.fromIsImportedClass)
    select any fromIClass related by self->O_IOBJ[R3] where
                                       (selected.IObj_ID == param.from);
    relate cir to fromIClass across R202;
  end if;

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The instance handle 'oir' has its name changed to 'cir' to match UML
nomenclature.

Unit Test
---------
_- Load the CanvasCreationModel test model.
_- Create a new Subsystem
_- Create a new class in this subsystem.
_- Add a superytpe connector
_- Import the class, Test Class 1
_- Connect this class as a subtype to the supertype connector
_- Delete the Imported Class instance.
_R The Imported Class and its associated subtype connector are both removed from
   the diagram.
   
Note that this test is added to the canvas creation test because it already has
the infrastructure for testing symbols that are created during runtime. Core
test failed to detect this defect because it runs on Builder created test
models. An issue is raised to repeat core tests on a model created using Tiger.
The deletion test proposed here in CanvasCreationTest can then be removed.
