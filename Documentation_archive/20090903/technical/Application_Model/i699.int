Tiger Implementation Note
Fix Transition.Dispose()

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to Transition.Dispose() to prevent metamodel
population inconsistencies.

History
-------

final i699-020405-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
Issue 699

Background
----------
When deleting a transition from a statechart diagram, the metamodel instances
for the state event matrix were deleted as well, causing errors when 
later operations (e.g., adding an event to a different transition) were
attempted.

Design
------

1.  Change Transition.Dispose to be less aggressive

The current implementation of Transition.Dispose() deletes the SM_SEME instance
associated with a New State Transition.  The operation is changed to only 
delete the transition data itself.  The SM_SEME instance data should only be
deleted when a state or event is deleted.

The operation is changed to:

select one nstxn related by self->SM_NSTXN[R507];
if (not_empty nstxn)
  // migrate to a No Event Transition (SM_NETXN)
  // which will be deleted below
  self.removeEvent();
end if;

select one crtxn related by self->SM_CRTXN[R507];
if (not_empty crtxn)
  self.removeEvent();
  unrelate self from crtxn across R507;
  delete object instance crtxn;
end if; 

select one netxn related by self->SM_NETXN[R507];
if (not_empty netxn)
  unrelate self from netxn across R507;
  select one state related by netxn->SM_STATE[R508];
  unrelate netxn from state across R508;
  delete object instance netxn;
end if;

select one sm related by self->SM_SM[R505];
unrelate self from sm across R505;
select one state related by self->SM_STATE[R506];
unrelate self from state across R506;
delete object instance self;

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The .cvsignore entries were added for the following files:

bp.core/doc/external/manuals/mm/ooaofooa_documentation.mif
ui.canvas.test/sql/*.sql
ui.text/src/com/projtech/bp/ui/text/editor/oal/LiteralRule.java

- Added CombineSplitReferentialsTest.java to the cvs_java_files property
in core.test/generate.xml

Unit Test
---------
_- Load Odms 
_- Open Disk Request Instance State Chart 
_- Delete reflexive transition 
_R Transition is deleted
_- Remove event from left over transition 
_- Select Assign Event 
_R Both events are available for assignment 
_- Select the event D_DQ1
_- Click Finish 
_R The assign event wizard is closed
_R The label is changed to D_DQ1

- The above test is automated in core.test/src/.../AssignRemoveEvents.java
