Tiger Project Implementation Note
Add associations between messages and their formal elements.

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to the generation of the dependency class
for properties in order to address a problem where the property view for 
certain Sequence Diagram entities is not refreshing properly.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue 2015

Background
----------
After being formalized, the properties window for a synchronous message 
object does not refresh unless the user re-selects the object.

<Reproduction>

1. Create a sequence diagram
2. Create an instance
3. Create an external entity 
4. Formalize the external entity
5. Draw a synchronous message from the instance to the external entity
6. Observe that the properties view shows the synchronous message 
   'Is Formal' attribute to be false
7. Formalize the synchronous message
8. Observe that the properties view still shows the synchronous message 
   'Is Formal' attribute to be false
9. Select another item in the diagram
10. Re-select the synchronous message
11. Observe that the properties view now shows the synchronous message 
    'Is Formal' attribute to be true

</Reproduction>

Design
------
ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql did not include the formal elements as children, and 
because of this the Synchronous / Asynchronous message 'Is Formal' property 
was not refreshing properly.

To resolve this, associations between messages and their formal elements in 
ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql are now defined so that the existing code that 
generated the dependency class will include the new associations, causing 
the properties to refresh properly.

List of all the classes affected:

	Formal External Entity
	Formal Function Package
	Formal Class
	Formal Instance
	Formal Attribute

	Formal Bridge Operation
	Formal Class Operation
	Formal Function
	Formal Event
	
	Formal Bridge Operation Parameter
	Formal Class Operation Parameter
	Formal Function Parameter
	Formal Event Data Item
	
List of all formal elements of compare.test model:

	External Entity
	Imported Class
	Instance
	Function Package
	Synchronous Message - formalized against the following
  		- Function (with one parameter)
  		- Class Operation (with one parameter)
  		- Bridge Operation (with one parameter)
	Asynchronous Message - formalized against an event 
	(with one data item assigned)
 
Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Originally the work was being done under a branch from HEAD called 
Review-i2015, but during the implementation process a new branch from R1_3_HEAD
called Review-i2015-01 was created. The changes in Review-i2015 were merged 
into Review-i2015-01, and implementation continued. Shortly after, Greg made 
some changes under his own branch, and these had to be merged into 
Review-i2015-01.

bp.compare.test
---------------
test.xtuml had to be modified to add the formal elements stated in the Design 
section. Once test.xtuml was updated, the expected results had to be updated 
to reflect the model changes; thus the reason for changes to testOAL1.txt.

bp.core
----------------
ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql had to be modified to create associations between 
messages and their formal elements so that the existing code that generated 
the dependency class would include the new associations.

bp.core.test
----------------
RefreshTestCore.java was created to contain a set of tests to make sure the 
'IsFormal' property of the messages was properly updating after the 
associations had been added to the ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql.

CoreTestSuite.java was modified to include RefreshTestCore.java into the 
CoreTestSuite JUNIT test.

SequenceTestModel.xtuml was modified to include a sequence diagram called 
RefreshTest to hold the formalized objects, messages, and parameters needed for 
the test implemented in RefreshTestCore.java. Once SequenceTestModel.xtuml was 
updated, the expected results had to be updated to reflect the model changes; 
thus the reason for changes to SequenceTest_42/4-1 & SequenceTest_42/4-1.jpg

See Greg's note regarding ModelTransactionTest.java & TigerNatureTest.java 

bp.ui.properties
----------------
See Greg's note 

bp.ui.properties.test
---------------------
RefreshTestProp.java was created to contain a set of tests to make sure the 
property display reflected the associations added to the 
ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql.

PropertiesTestSuite.java was modified to include RefreshTestProp.java into the 
PropertiesTestSuite JUNIT test.

TestProp.xtuml was modified to include the formalized objects, messages, and 
parameters needed for the test implemented in RefreshTestProp.java.

See Greg's note regarding DeleteUDTWithPropertyShowing.java, 
EnumRangeTest.java, NumberRangeTest.java, create_readonly_view_test.arc, and 
create_view_test.arc

Greg's note
-----------
When making the changes to ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql, it was noticed that
the properties view for MSG_A was incorrect.  This was due to there being
two T_TNS instances that both referenced the MSG_A class.  The fix for this
was to change how the 'PropertySource' classes are named.  The previous
name was "$r{class.Name}PropertySource".  It was changed to 
"$r{node.CategoryName}${class.Key_Lett}PropertySource".  This change was
made in BuildPropertySource.arc, create_readonly_view_test.arc, and
create_view_test.arc.  Places where handwritten code (test cases) referenced
the old naming style were changed to use the new naming style.

Other files changed were generate.xml, ModelTransactionTest.java, 
TigerNaturetest.java, DeleteUDTWithPropertyShowing.java, EnumRangeTest.java, 
and NumberRangeTest.java

Unit Test
---------
A new test, RefreshTestCore.java, under 
/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.test/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/core/test/ui will 
test the 'IsFormal' value of the affected classes / formal elements while 
Informal & Formal.

A new test, RefreshTestProp.java, under 
/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.properties.test/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/ui/
properties/test will test the properties display of each affected 
class / formal element to make sure the appropriate item is listed.

Modify bp.core.test/generate.xml to add RefreshTestCore.java to property
'cvs_java_files', the list of hand-written java files.

Modify ui.properties.test/generate.xml to add RefreshTestProp.java to property
'cvs_java_files', the list of hand-written java files.
