Tiger Implementation Note
Model Diff doesn't close/free compared resources' streams

Abstract
--------
This implementation note describes the solution for freeing the Un-released
File Streams in the bp.compare.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue # 510
[2] bp.core/doc/technical/internal/Compare/compare-i175.int

Background
----------
While using the Tiger Compare functionality between two models the following 
observation is made:
_-  Compare any two models (.mdl files) using the option in context menu, 
    Compare  With -> Each Other
_-  (Optional) Close the comparison window
_-  Delete any one file out of the above two compared.
_R  The workbench gives error "Problems encountered while deleting resources".

Design
------
- i510.1  Close the required File Streams
  Close the InputStream object (i.e. sca) created in 
ModelCacheManager.ModelMapEntry.loadModel(). Add code sca.close() at the end 
of the method.

Work Required
-------------
- i510.1  Close the required File Streams
  Update bp.compare/src/com/projtech/bp/compare/ModelCacheManager.java file as
described in Design section.


Implementation Notes
----------------------
- com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql was giving compilation errors which
 were arising due to direct check-in of this project on HEAD during the 
issue i385. The associated changes to MC-Java on the other hand were branched. 
These changes have been reverted back to resolve the compilation errors in 
com.projtech.bp.internal.io.sql.



Unit Test
---------
Add following test to the com.projtech.bp.compare.test
 CompareFileDeletionCheck.java
  This test checks for deletion of files after their comparison when 
  the InputStream has been closed and vice versa.
  The method 'void testFileDeletion()' performs the test.
_-   Deletes two model files after comparing them with each other. Perform this 
    tasks repeatedly.
_R The files are deleted successfully in each cycle of execution of above 
   action and no failure message is shown as the result of the action.
   
Note : This above action cycle was executed 10 times with InputStream closed 
       and 10 times when stream was not closed. In first case, 100% successful 
       results were achieved. where as in second case a failure was faced on 
       almost every second cycle. The reason of the failure in second case 
       seems to be the late cleaning by garbage collector (not closing the 
       stream is obviously the main cause). i.e. deletion has been tried when 
       garbage collector has not returned the resources (that is it has not 
       closed the stream by itself). Successful results of the second case are
       obtained because the garbage collector has returned the resources on-
       time.

_-  Run all unit tests given in compare-i175.int
_R  All tests run successfully.
