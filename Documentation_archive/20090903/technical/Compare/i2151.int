Tiger Implementation Note
Unwanted Operations

Abstract
--------
This document describes the implementation details of the work done for 
excluding PLCM's Unwanted Operations. It includes the changes made to Meta Data
and corresponding changes made to all other plugins. 

History
-------
None.

Background
----------
See Design Note [1].

Design
------

The purpose of cached attributes was to cache values of attributes, external to 
the model class that are used for generating readable names. It was done for
compare. 

followings are the places where the Orphaned Elements used.
-_ *State Machine -> Instance State Machine -> get_name() (across the boundary
   but not needed)
-_ *State Machine -> Class State Machine -> get_name()(across the boundary but
   not needed)
-_ SS -> Derived Base Attribute -> get_name() (within the boundary)
-_ SS -> Model Class -> get_compartment_text() (DT)
-_ SS -> Attribute -> Name (within the boundary)
-_ State Machine -> Local Event -> get_name() (within the boundary)
-_ State Machine -> Action -> get_name() (within the boundary)
-_ State Machine -> New State Transition -> get_connector_text()(within the boundary)
-_ State Machine -> State Machine Event -> get_name ()(within the boundary)
-_ *State Machine -> State Machine Event -> Drv_Lbl (across the boundary but not
   needed)
-_ Domain -> Enumeration Data type -> get_compartment_text() (DT)
-_ Domain -> User Data type -> get_compartment_text() (DT)
-_ Domain -> Core Data type -> get_compartment_text() (DT)
-_ Domain -> External Entity -> get_compartment_text() (DT)
-_ SS -> Imported Class-> Obj_KL  (within the boundary)

Some of them are across the boundaries and some are within the boundaries. So,
within the boundaries elements can be calculated. 
*There are also no need of some of the across the boundary elements like, in a
state machine the class key letter is no needed. 
The data types (DT) are across the boundary but it uses the within the boundary
names to represent the text.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1. Remove the Unwanted Operations from ooaofooa.xtuml those were added in 
   model compare functionality for PLCM issue. These operations had no use, so, 
   it needs to remove.
   SubSystem -> Attribute Reference in Class - > getRefClassName
   SubSystem -> Attribute Reference in Class - > getRefAttrName
   SubSystem -> Attribute Reference in Class - > getRefOver
2. Added use of cached attribute in the following operations.
   SubSystem -> Attribute Reference in Class - > get_name
   SubSystem -> Attribute Reference in Class - > get_text
3. Resolve the CVS versioning problem while checking the tree elements of Model
   Explorer in FileVsFolder_i1608Test.java test.

Unit Test
---------
All unit tests specified by PLCM-i1761.int [2] pass.
