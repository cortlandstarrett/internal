Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fix Getting Started Demo .xpj file for Optimized Build Configuration


Abstract
--------

The Getting Started Demo creates 3 Build Configurations, Debug, Model Debug,
and Optimized.  The Optimized build configurations creates a build.exe instead
of a MicrowaveOven.exe because the output parameter of the Optimized build
configuration specifcation in the .xpj file is missing.
