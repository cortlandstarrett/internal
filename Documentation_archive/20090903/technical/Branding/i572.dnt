Tiger Project Design Note

Update Model Debugger Branding

Abstract
--------

The branding of the Model Debugger must be updated to match the Tiger
products.

History
-------

i572-041205-01.rvm final

Document References
-------------------

[1]  Bugzilla 572

[2]  Bugzilla 437

[3]  PolyView image conversion tool
     //svr-azt-fil-01/software_archive/polyview/polyview4.23.exe

Background
----------

The Model Debugger product was developed before the adoption of the Eclipse
platform by Project Technology.  A certain amount of branding must be done in
order for it to more closely match the look and feel of the Eclipse based
products.

Analysis
--------

The Model Debugger System Browser displays model elements in a tree structure
similar to that of the Tiger Model Builder Model Explorer view.  The System
Browser shall be modified to use the same icons as the Model Explorer.  Also the
terminology 'statechart' shall be changed to 'state machine'.

The Model Debugger splash screen image must be updated.

The 'About' dialog box contact and copyright information must be updated.

It will not be necessary to update the contact information in the error message
dialog box because that was updated as part of the licensing issue 437 [2].

By default the existing Model Debugger accesses pages posted on the old Project
Technology website, which is no longer running.  The Model Debugger shall be
modified to access the Eclipse-based Tiger help documentation.

Design
------

i572.1 Update the System Browser icons.

i572.2 Update the System Browser terminology.

i572.3 Update the splash screen image.

i572.4 Update the 'About' box contact and copyright information.

i572.5 Update Help to use Eclipse-based Help to access the Tiger documentation.

Design Comments
---------------

(1) Because the Model Debugger is version controlled in Razor, the matching
Razor issue for this project is akula:555.

Work Required
-------------

i572.1 Update the System Browser icons.

    .1.1 Extract copies of the icon gif files from Tiger.
    Extract attribute.gif, bridge.gif, bridgeparameter.gif, class.gif,
    classstatechart.gif, event.gif, eventdata.gif, externalentity.gif,
    function.gif, instance.gif, operation.gif, operationparameter.gif,
    state.gif, and system.gif.
    
    .1.2 Create instance.gif.
    
    .1.3 Create breakpoint and breakpoint disabled icons.
    For each of the following icon gif files create matching break enabled and
    break disabled icons: attribute.gif, instance.gif, bridge.gif, class.gif,
    event.gif, function.gif, operation.gif and state.gif.
    
    .1.4 Create a new images.hpp file
    
    .1.4.1 Import the icon gif files into PolyView [3] and then export them as
    XPM formatted files.
    
    .1.4.2 Concatenate the XPM formatted files into a single new images.hpp
    file.
    
    .1.4.3 Change each XPM format character array to be 'static const'.
    
    .1.4.4 Change the names of each character array so that they contain only
    lower case letters.
    
    .1.4.5 Change the background of each character array, as needed, from white
    '#ffffff' to 'None'.
    
    .1.4.6 Paste into the new images.hpp file from the old file the character
    arrays for the following images: green_arrow_data, red_dot_data,
    black_square_data, green_arrow_state_data, imageTargetBlocked_data,
    imageTargetRunning_data, and imageNoTarget_data.
    
    .1.4.7 Paste into the new images.hpp a standard header.

    .1.5 Modify tis.sql
    
    .1.5.1 Edit each insert TIS.  Change the third parameter from the old icon
    name to the new icon name.
    
    .1.6  Modify the pixmap map.
    
    .1.6.1 Edit the build_pixmaps_map member function of the ptc_icon_c class
    in ptc_icons.cpp.
    Map the pixmap names to the icon names.  Here is a typical example:
    ---
    pm = new QPixmap( bridge_data );
    pixmaps.insert( NAME2PM::value_type("bridge", pm) );
    ---
    
i572.2 Update the System Browser terminology.

    .2.1 Edit tf.sql.
    
    .2.1.1 Change the Literal_Text names 'class state chart',
    'instance state chart', and 'object state chart' to 'class state machine,
    'instance state machine', and 'object state machine'.
    
    .2.1.2 Change the Literal_Text names 'class state machine' and
    'object state machine' to 'class state' and 'object state'.
    
    .2.1.3 Add a standard header.
    
i572.3 Update the splash screen image.

    .3.1 Extract a copy of splash.bmp from Tiger.
    
    .3.2 Import splash.bmp into PolyView and then export as a PNG formatted file
     named splash.PNG.
    
    .3.3 Replace the existing splash.PNG with the new version created in the
    previous step.
    
    .3.4 Run the Qt uic tool to create splash.h from splash.PNG.
    For example:
    c:/Qt/3.2.1/bin/uic -o splash.h -embed splash splash.PNG
    
    .3.5 Edit the new splash.h
    
    .3.5.1 Add a standard check for multiple header inclusion. For example,
    '#ifndef MODEL_DBG_SPLASH_H' and '#define MODEL_DBG_SPLASH_H' at the top
    of the file and '#endif' at the bottom.
    
    .3.5.2 Change the definitions of the functions qInitImages_splash and
    qCleanupImages_splash to make them static.
    
    .3.6 Edit the call to uic_findImage in ptc_app.cpp.  Specify 'splash.PNG'
    instead of 'splash.png'.
    
i572.4 Update the 'About' box contact and copyright information.
     The blue_window::helpAbout function builds and displays the About dialog
     box.
    
    .4.1 Update the copyright and contact information stored in the Qstring msg
    variable.
    
    .4.2 Adjust the location of the QTextEdit 'credits' text box to an
    appropriate location in the new splash screen image.
    
    .4.3 Change the properties of the 'credits' text box such that it is
    transparent.
    
i572.5 Update Help to use Eclipse-based Help to access the Tiger documentation.

    .5.1 Use the Qt V3.0.5 Designer to edit exctrlwind.ui file.
    
    .5.1.1 Remove the helpOnline and helpIndex signal handlers.
    
    .5.1.2 Remove the helpOnlineAction and helpIndexAction actions.
    
    .5.1.3 Edit the Help menu bar entry.
    
    .5.1.3.1 Remove the 'Index...' and 'Web Resources...' entries.
    
    .5.1.3.2 Remove the extra Separator.
    
    .5.2 Remove declarations for helpIndex and helpOnline from blue_window.h.
    
    .5.3 Modify the showOnlineHelp member function of blue_window in
    blue_window.cpp.
    
    .5.3.1 Read the values of MGC_MD_ECLIPSE and MGC_MD_JVM as well as
    MGC_MD_HELP.
    
    .5.3.2 Check all three registry keys for empty values and display warning
    dialog box if any are empty.
    
    .5.3.3 If all 3 registry keys are not empty, pass them to openDocument.
    
    .5.4 Modify the openDocument member function of blue_window.
    
    .5.4.1 Modify to pass in two additional parameters.  One for the Java VM
    location, one for the location of Eclipse Home.
    
    .5.4.2 Add a check that the Eclipse Help plugin can be found.
    Display a warning dialog and return immediately if it cannot.
    
    .5.4.3 Combine the 3 parameters into a command line to call Eclipse Help.
    
    .5.4.4 Use Windows CreateProcess to call Eclipse Help.
    
    .5.4.5 Check the return value of CreateProcess and if it is FALSE,
    display a warning dialog box saying that Help could not be started.
    
    .5.5 Remove no longer needed blue_window member functions.
    
    .5.5.1 Remove definitons for helpIndex and helpOnline.

Unit Test
---------

- Setup MGLS licensing on the test computer.
- Setup a standalone Tiger installation on the test computer.
- Install the new Model Debugger on the test computer in a place similar to
  where it be located by the new production installer.
- Create a new Registry key string value MGC_MD_HELP to be the
  location of the Eclipse-based Model Debugger help page.  If that has not been
  determined at test time, use: '/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc/gettingStarted
  /GettingStarted.htm'.
- Create a new Registry key string value MGC_MD_JVM and set its value to be the
  location of the Java Virtual Machine.  A typical value might be:
  'c:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.2_06\bin\javaw.exe'.
- Create a new Registry key strinb value MGC_MD_ECLIPSE and set its value to be
  the location of Eclipse home.  A typical value might be: 'c:\tiger'.
- Create a Model Debugger enabled executable that contains model elements for
  each of the new icons.
- Start the Model Debugger.
R The new Nucleus BridgePoint splash screen displays for a few seconds and
  then closes.
- Open the test executable.
- Open the System Browser.
- Examine each element with a new icon.
R The correct new icon is displayed.
- For each new icon that may contain a breakpoint, set a breakpoint.
R The icon changes to the correct break-enabled icon.
- For each new icon that may contain a breakpoint, disable the breakpoint.
R The icon changes to the correct break-disabled icon.
- For each new icon that may contain a breakpoint, clear the breakpoint.
R The icon changes to the correct icon without a breakpoint symbol.
- Display an instance state machine in the System Browser.
R The correct terminology 'instance state machine' displays instead of the
  old terminology 'instance state chart'.
- Display an object state machine in the System Browser.
R The correct terminology 'object state machine' displays instead of the old
  terminology 'object state chart'.
- Display a class state machine in the System Browser.
R The correct terminology 'class state machine' displays instead of the old
  terminology 'class state chart'.
- Display an instance of an object state machine.
R The terminology for the state of the object displays as 'object state' instead
  of the old terminology 'object state machine'.
- Display an instance of a class state machine.
R The terminology for the state of the class displays as 'class state' instead
  of the old terminology 'class state machine'.
- From the main Menu Bar select 'Help | About ...'.
R The background image of the About dialog box is the new Nucleus BridgePoint
  splash screen image.
R The text box in the dialog box displays the correct copyright and contact
  information.
