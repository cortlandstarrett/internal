Tiger Implementation Note
Ensure install and help match release notes modules and revisions

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

The licensing data files are moved from com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg to
each of the new com.mentor.nucleus.bp.*.pkg plugins, since that is now the 
logical home for them. The reference to these in bp.core/plugin.xml is removed.
Each plugin.xml has the extension point for the licensing added to it. The 
product files have the (now unneeded) suffix removed from them, and are added to
the build.properties file.

In create_nightly_build.sh, the second call to get_required_modules is used to
get the list of required modules from the latest nightly build version of the
bp.bld.pkg-feature package.  The for loop which follows it is used to verify
that the script was able to check out that version, but uses the modules
variable instead of the release_pkg variable.  At this point the modules
variable is empty and nothing is being verified.  The modules variable is
changed to the release_pkg variable.  Also the design note for this issue called
for adding the all_feature_modules variable to this for loop.  This is incorrect
and therefore is not added.

The zip_distribution function in create_tiger_release.sh was changed to use
the plugin version when creating the plugin directories, rather than the release
version.  It also no longer needs to update the path for the productName
element in the core plugin.xml (due to the product files being moved to their
respective plugins).

build.xml was added to .cvsignore for the new plugins/features

Organize imports on the following files:

ComparePlugin.java
ICompareHelpContextIds.java
ModelContentMergeViewer.java
GettingStartedLiveHelpAction.java

ModelContentMergeViewer.java invocation of getControl() was changed to call
super.getControl() to disambiguate the invocation.

New projects were added to new-start.chk (including mc3020 plugin)
