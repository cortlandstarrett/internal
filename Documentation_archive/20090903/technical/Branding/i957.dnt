Tiger Project Design Note
Ensure install and help match release notes modules and revisions

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes needed to make the installed component list, the
installer and the release notes consistent and accurate with respect to what is
being released.

Background
----------
QA have observed that the installer module selection tree and Help > Features
need to match with the list of released modules in the release notes.

Analysis
--------
The current product structure shall be:

  Nucleus BridgePoint UML Suite            7.0.1
    Nucleus BridgePoint Model Builder      1.0.1
    Nucleus BridgePoint Model Debugger     1.3.0
    Nucleus BridgePoint Generator          7.0.0
    Nucleus BridgePoint MC-3020            4.0.1

Note BridgePoint 7.0.0 is what was passed to QA May 16th. BridgePoint 7.0.1
shall be the version actually released once QA confirms that all issues are
resolved.

Design
------
The following things need to change to match the above hierarchy as closely as
possible:

1. The installer needs to specify:

   EDGE 1.1.1
     Nucleus BridgePoint UML Suite   7.0.1
       Nucleus BridgePoint MC-3020   4.0.1

   Note that the installer cannot include items that are not individually
   configurable by the user. The description for BridgePoint 7.0.1 shall state
   that it consists of the four products at the specified four revisions.

2. The release notes need to clearly state that the released product is
   BridgePoint 7.0 and that it is made up of the component products at the
   revisions specified above.

3. Declare four new Eclipse Features, one for each of the component products
   specified above. The xtUML suite product feature shall reuse the existing
   com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg feature. The suite shall be the primary feature and
   the other features shall be included by the primary feature. The feature
   revision numbers shall match the revisions specified above. Each feature must
   have its own feature folder, its own feature.xml file and its own
   corresponding plugin. Accordingly, the following new features and matching
   plugins are created:

   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.dbg.pkg
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.gen.pkg
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.pkg
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg

   The newly created plugins each contain the minimum resources to permit
   Eclipse to recognize them as features. This includes branding images etc.

   The plugins list formerly in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg-feature is moved to
   com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.   
   
4. The following plugins shall have their internal revision numbers incremented
   in line with changes made during the QA cycle:

   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.als.oal
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.canvas
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.properties
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.text
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.core
   - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.welcome

   This puts these plugins at revision 1.0.1.

5. The following changes shall be made to the build scripts:

   The variable 'release_pkg' shall be set to:
   
   'com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg-feature'

   The variable 'pkg_module' shall be set to:
   
   'com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg'
   
   The build scripts shall use build.properties as the specification for what is
   to be included in the release. Each build.properties file shall contain only
   a bin.includes entry.

   Three new variables shall be added: feature_modules, feature_pkg_modules and
   all_feature_modules to create_release_functions.sh.  These variables shall
   contain the plugins specified above, except 'com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg'
   and 'com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg-feature' which are already specified in
   release_pkg and pkg_module above. They will also contain the 'bp.pkg-feature'
   and 'bp.pkg plugins'.

   A new variable, all_feature_modules will be added to the following locations:

   In create_nightly_build.sh:

   checkif_modified function - (this will allow for triggering nightly builds)
   remove_extraction function - (for cleanup purposes)
   all_verify_checkout for loops - (to verify checkouts)
   promotion for loop - (to allow promotions)

   In create_release_functions.sh

   extract_release_files (allows for the modules to be checked out)

   In create_tiger_release.sh

   all_modules variable - (to allow verification)

   A new function is added to create_tiger_release.sh, create_all_features, this
   function calls the original create_feature function and packages all the new
   features.

Design Comments
---------------

Work Required
-------------
1.  The installer work shall be carried out in Mobile. No additional work is
    required by Tucson engineering.
   
2.  The release notes are updated as described in the design under the work for
    i940[3].

3.1 Create eight new projects; four feature type and four plugin type, for the
    features specified in the design:

    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.dbg.pkg
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.dbg.pkg-feature
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.gen.pkg
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.gen.pkg-feature
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.pkg
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020.pkg-feature
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg
    - com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg-feature

3.2 Migrate the required plugins list from com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg-feature to
    com.mentor.nucleus.bp.bld.pkg-feature.

4.  The changes shall be made to the plugin.xml files of each plugin specified
    in the design.

5.  The changes specified in the design are made to; create_nightly_build.sh,
    create_release_functions.sh and create_tiger_release.sh.

Unit Test
---------
_- Install BridgePoint.
_R The BridgePoint installer shows the tree as specified.
_R The description of BridgePoint 7.0.1 shows the four components at the
   revisions specified.
_- Once BridgePoint is installed, open the release notes.
_R The release notes show the product hierarchy as specified at the specified
   revisions.
_- Select Help > About Nucleus BridgePoint . . .
_- Click 'Features'.
_R The five features are shown with the revision numbers as specified in the
   design.

- These tests must be done after at least one NB tag has been added on the new
  plugins, the tag must be a maintanence (M) tag.

_- On svr-azt-eng-01 run './create_nightly_build.sh R1_0_HEAD'
_R The script completes without error
_- Check d:/nightly_build/nightly_builds/M(the tag used above)
_R The directory contains the new plugins added

_- Tag all projects in the M(tag above) versions with R1_0_1_Test
_- On svr-azt-eng-01 run './create_tiger_release.sh R1_0_1_Test
_R The script completes without error
_- Using the plugins created from above follow the first half of this unit test
   section 
_R All steps pass
