BridgePoint Implementation Note
Fix the nightly build



1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the steps taken to get the nightly build of BridgePoint
working again.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bug 2553.  http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2553
[2] i2553 Design note.  <CVS>/Documentation/internal/technical/Build/i2553.dnt

4. Background
-------------
The nightly build is currently not working.  This note describes the steps to 
get it working as well as a process change to tag issue fixing changesets.

5. Design
---------
5.1     com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core/tools/create_nightly_build.sh
5.1.1   This script was essentially rewritten.
5.1.2   Instead of performing lots of processing work, the script simply runs
        the BridgePoint release script using the HEAD tag.
5.1.3   After running the release process on HEAD, it saves a copy of the HEAD
        build into a dated directory "HEAD-<build date>" in the normal 
        BridgePoint release location.
5.1.4   Nightly builds that are older than five days are removed
5.1.5   An e-mail is still sent on completion
        
5.2     The promotion tag is changed from N<YYYYMMDD> to 
        chgset-i<issue#>[-i<issue#2>..etc].  This process change required
        updating:
          - Documentation/internal/process/Process.txt
          - Documentation/internal/process/templates/checklists/promotion.chk
          - MC-Documentation/internal/process/templates/checklists/promotion.chk

5.3     Turned off the maintenance build scheduled task on the build server.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1     com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core/tools/create_tiger_release.sh
6.1.1   Added a check to disallow a user to run a release on a tag that already 
        exists (except HEAD), thereby making sure we don't overwrite an existing
        release.
6.1.2   Added "-f" flags to do forceful moves and copies of the built plugin to 
        make sure we overwrite an existing release zipfile.  This case should 
        only be applicable when building HEAD, due to the change described in 
        6.1.1.
        
6.2     Because the method used to prune old release directories relies on the
        directory timestamp (passing "-mtime 5" to find), the unit test in the 
        design note cannot work as designed.
        
6.3     The build scripts were copied to the build server (svr-azt-eng-01) in
        the folder d:\nightly_build.  This is the location they are actually
        ran from.
        
7. Unit Test
------------
7.1     The nightly build ran successfully via manual invocation and as a 
        scheduled task on 11/1/06
7.2     We will need to check that the pruning is working in a couple of days.
