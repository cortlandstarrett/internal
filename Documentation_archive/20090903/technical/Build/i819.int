Tiger Implementation Note
Include .nucleusproduct in tiger releases

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes necessary for including .nucleusproduct in tiger
releases.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
Issue 819

Background
----------
The addition of licensing support to tiger required the file,
bp.pkg/.nucleusproduct, to be included in a release.  Without this file tiger
will not run properly.

Design
------
i819.1 Add .nucleusproduct file to build.properties

The release script is setup to read the build.properties bin.includes variable
from the bp.pkg plugin for files that belong in a release.  In order to support
the licensing changes the .nucleusproduct file is added to the build.properties
bin.includes variable.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
During the last release creation a few errors were given at the end of the
release process.  These errors were due to a copy of a plugin's
plugin.properties, where some plugins did not contain the file.  An if test was
added around the copy command to see if the file exists before copying.

Rather than including the com.mentor.nucleus.product in the release,
a link to the file is added to the download page.

Unit Test
---------
_- Tag all projects which contain the N20050404 tag with R1_0_0_M8_i819
_- Move the R1_0_0_M8_i819 tag to the latest version of bp.pkg/build.properties
_- Run the tiger release script, passing R1_0_0_M8_i819 as the only
	argument
_R The script completes with out error
_- Install the created plugins and open the xtUML perspective
_R The model explorer view is shown without error
