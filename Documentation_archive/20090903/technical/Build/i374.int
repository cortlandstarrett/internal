Tiger Implementation Note
Support for promoting unit test modules

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes necessary for adding promotion support for the
unit test modules.

Issue 374

Background
----------

The unit test modules currently are ignored by the nightly build script.  They
must be promoted along with the other modules to correctly maintain version
control. 

Design
------

i374.1 Add function to check out unit test modules

The unit test modules need a function added which will check out all the
necessary files for those modules.

A variable, unit_test_modules, is added to create_release_functions.sh, which
contains a list of the currently available unit test modules.

A new function, extract_unit_test_modules, is added to
create_release_functions.sh.  The function contains a for loop which iterates
through the modules listed in the unit_test_modules variable.  For each module,
the function calls the rsh command to check out the current module on the cvs
server.  The chown command is then called recursively on the current module to
change the ownership of the files and directories to the user running the
nightly build script.  

i374.2 Add support for modified check

The unit test modules shall be treated like the other modules included with
Tiger.  They need to trigger a nightly build if they have any files tagged with
the current nightly build tag.  This is done by checking out the unit test
modules before the call to checkif_modified and adding support for the unit test
modules to that same function.

i374.3 Add support for promoting unit test modules

The unit test modules need to be version controlled in the same manner as the
other Tiger modules.  The unit test modules shall be extracted right before the
call to promote the other Tiger modules.  Support for the unit test modules in
the promotion call is added.

i374.4 Manually promote unit test modules 

The unit test modules are currently not up to date with the nightly build tags.
In order for the nightly build script to operate correctly all the unit test
modules must be tagged with the last successful nightly build tag.

Work Required
-------------

i374.1 Add function to check out unit test modules

The changes are made to the create_release_functions.sh script.

i374.2 Add support for modified check

A call to the function created in i374.1 is added to the nightly build script
before the checkif_modified function is called.  The unit_test_modules variable
added in i374.1 is added to the list of modules used in the checkif_modified
function.

The unit_test_modules variable is added to the list of modules used in the
remove_extraction function adding support for removing the temporary extractions
of the unit test modules. 

i374.3 Add support for promoting unit test modules

A call to the extract_unit_test_modules function is added before the promotions
are made.

The unit_test_modules variable is added to the list of modules to be promoted.

i374.4 Manually promote unit test modules

All unit test modules are manually brought up to date with the last successful
nightly build tag.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

After running the unit test for this work a bug was found with the
verify_checkout calls in create_nightly_build.sh.  The verify_checkout function
depends on the module variable being set.  This variable was not being set before
the verify_checkout calls.  The correct way to verify all modules is to surround
the call with a for loop which iterates through all the modules needing to be
verified.  The module variable is set to the current module being verified in
the for loop.  Therefore, the following for loop is added to
create_nightly_build.sh around each call to verify_checkout:

for module in ${modules in question}; do
	verify_checkout >> ${NB_RUN_LOG}
done

The modules in question variable above is to be replaced with a list of modules
needing to be verified for that call. 

The checkif_modified function in create_nightly_build.sh currently uses a
'greater than or equal to' logic in its if test for the dir_count value.  This
will cause a nightly build to occur every night because the value will always
be equal to one even if there are no modified files.  The function's if test is
changed to check if the value is greater than one.

The modified_files variable should be set to false initially and the
checkif_modified function should set the variable to true if it finds modified
files.  If no modified files exist the script should exit but because the
variable is not set to false it will not exit.  The create_nightly_build.sh
script is modified to set the modified_files variable to false in the start of
the script.

Unit Test
---------

Log in to the build machine (whimbrel) using user: build.

Back up the existing shell script files.

Copy the changed files to \\whimbrel\nightly_build\.

Modify the create_nightly_build.sh to change the BUILD_ADMIN setting:

BUILD_ADMIN="<your_email_address>@mentor.com"

Modify create_release_functions.sh to use the test repository:

cvsroot="/arch1/sun/u/tlondon/work/repository"

In Eclipse, switch to the CVS view to do the tagging in this test. Set up the
repository above, logging in as build.

Now complete the following:

- Tag a file in one of the unit test modules with the days date
- Run the nightly build script
R Script runs the nightly build
R Script completes without error
R The above tag exists on all files in all the unit test modules

If the test passes, undo the edits specified in the Unit test.
If the test fails, restore the backed up files.
