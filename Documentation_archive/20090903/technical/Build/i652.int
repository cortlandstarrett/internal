Tiger Implementation Note
Prevention of unneeded cme rebuilds after clean

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes necessary for preventing unwanted cme rebuilds.

History
-------

final i652-010705-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
Issue 652

Background
----------
The cme_menus target is being called everytime the cme_actions target is called.
This is because the cme_actions target touches its output file at the end of
execution.  This behavior prevents using dependencies correctly because the
cme_actions output will always have a modified timestamp, causing the cme_menus
target to run.  

Design
------
i652.1 Remove touch call on cme_actions output

The touch task is removed from the cme_actions target to prevent timestamp
changes when the actual data did not change.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

During the unit test for this issue a dependency problem for cme_actions was
found.  The cme_actions target is dependent on ooaofooa.sql's timestamp.  If
the ooaofooa.mdl file never changes, but the ooaofooa.sql is removed, the newly
generated ooaofooa.sql will have a newer timestamp then the output of
cme_actions.  This causes a cme_actions rebuild when one should only be
triggered if the data actual changed in ooaofooa.sql.  The dependency is
therefore placed on the ooaofooa.mdl model so that a cme_actions rebuild will
only occur if the model data actually changed.

The unit test fails because if ran in order, the cme_actions target will always
run.  This is due to the fact that its dependency is found by comparing
timestamps of its output, cme_actions.sql, and its input, ooaofooa.mdl.  The 
first unit test directs the reviewer to make a change to ooaofooa.mdl without
changing the data, this causes cme_actions.sql to never change.  Therefore, the
timestamp of cme_actions.sql is always going to be earlier than ooaofooa.mdl.
This is addressed by touching a build file, .cme_actions_last_build, at the end
of the cme_actions target.  This touched file is what is used in place of
cme_actions.sql for finding its dependencies.  Now if ooaofooa.mdl is modified
but the cme_actions output didn't change, the last run is still captured in
the touched file. The touch file is to be ignored by CVS.

Work Required
-------------
i652.1 Remove touch call on cme_actions output

The changes are made to generate.xml according to the design.

Unit Test
---------
_- Modify ooaofooa.mdl without actually changing the data
_- Run the all target
_R The cme_menus target is not run

Unit test for implementation comment:

_- Delete ooaofooa.sql and rebuild
_R The cme_actions target is not run
