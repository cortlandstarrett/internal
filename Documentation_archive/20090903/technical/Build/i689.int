Tiger Implementation Note
Modify build system to check out Documentation project

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes necessary for allowing the nightly
builds to complete the bp.core doc ant target successfully.

History
-------
final - i689-011805-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------

Background
----------
The nightly builds have started to fail because the documentation was moved into
its own project.  The bp.core ant target, doc, generates documentation based on
data found in the Documentation project.  Currently the nightly builds do not
check out the Documentation project, therefore the doc target fails causing the
nightly builds to fail.

Design
------
i689.1 Modify release functions script to check out Documentation project

The ant doc target found in core is currently setup correctly.  The only problem
is the missing Documentation project.

The create_releases_functions.sh script is modified to include Documentation in
the internal_modules variable.  Since this variable is processed and the
contents are checked out, this allows the doc target to access its required
files.

i689.2 Move doc target to the end of the nb_all depends target list

In order to prevent the rest of the build process from failing due to
documentation problems the documentation target is moved to the end of the
depends list for the nb_all target. 

i689.3 Tag existing documenation project

In order to have the nightly builds check out the project correctly, the project
must be tagged with a previous nightly build.

The documentation project is tagged with N20050117 to prepare for proper nightly
builds.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

During the unit test for this issue some script errors were seen.  The errors
happened because the script checks for build errors and compile errors for every
module except for com.projtech.bp.als.oal.  The Documentation project is added
to the check for not searching for build and compile errors because it does not
build or compile.

Unit Test
---------
_- Backup the existing directory,
   /cygdrive/d/nightly_build/nightly_builds/N20050118 on svr-azt-eng-01
_- Run the create_nightly_builds.sh script passing '20050118' as the only
   argument
_R There are no errors during the nightly build
_- Replace the backed up directory from above

Code Changes
