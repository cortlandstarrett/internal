Tiger Implementation Note
Make MC-3020 work out of the box

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes needed to allow the getting started procedure
to take the user through translating a model.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Since some folder names changed in the welcome plugin, the release script needs
to be updated to reflect these changes.  The file,
bp.core/tools/create_tiger_release.sh, is modified to copy the md-samples folder
and the models folder instead of the sample-project folder.

It was found that the rename functionality of the MC-3020 plugin introduced
under[4] had never worked correctly. This defect was fixed, which caused a unit
test to fail because it was testing for the old, incorrect behavior. The old
marking files were being left during a rename when they should have been removed
and hence should have been removed. The test is updated.

Unit Test
---------
This test now requires that MC3020 be installed in the test environment. At the
time of writing, this is revision 3.7.2. This version has an incorrect
default-manifest file that must be replaced with the one attached below. See the
Test_Readme file for full details of required setup.

Ran the standard system unit tests. Result: All Pass.
