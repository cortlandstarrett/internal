Tiger Implementation Note
Set build timeout values for new server

Abstract
--------

This note describes the necessary changes for setting the ant build script
timeout values for the new server.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------

Issue 422

Background
----------

The original build server, whimbrel, has contracted a virus.  Restrictions were
placed on whimbrel because of this virus.  Because of these restrictions the
build process was unable to complete.  The solution for the above problem was to
move the build system to a new server.  During the nightly build runs a timeout
was hit in the ui.explorer ant build script causing the build to fail.

Design
------

i422.1	Install modified ant package

The modified ant installation found on phoenix at
/software/software_archive/Eclipse/Ant/apache-ant-1.6.1-pt.zip, is installed on
the new server.  It is installed at c:/eclipse/ant. 

i422.2	Run set_exec_call_timeouts.sh script

The set_exec_call_timeouts.sh script is run with this issue number as its only
argument.

Work Required
-------------

i422.1 Install modified ant package

The changes are made according to the design.

i422.2 Run set_exec_call_timeouts.sh script

The changes are made according to the design.
 
Implementation Comments
-----------------------

When the com.projtech.bp.compare project was added to tiger, it was not added to
the list of projects to build and time.  The project is added to the list of
modules to build and time in the set_exec_call_timeouts.sh script.

bp.core's generate.xml build script has the inspector.java target missing from
the nb_all target.  The inspector.java target is added.

bp.compare's generate.xml script is missing a nb_all target for nightly builds.
The nb_all target is added.

Due to the speed constraints on the new server, the timeout values for the
timed build are set to 1000000 milliseconds.

Unit Test
---------

_- Run the set_exec_call_timeouts.sh script on a test repository passing 16 (Bugzilla issue for tracking repository work) as an argument
_R The script completes without error
_R All timeout values are set in the test repository
_- Rebuild tiger from head on the new server.
_R No timeouts are hit during the build procedure.
