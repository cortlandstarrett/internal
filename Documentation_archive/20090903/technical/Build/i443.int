Tiger Implementation Note
Modify release checklist to be more accurate.

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes necessary for bringing the release creation
checklist up to date.

History

Issue 443
Issue 524

Background
----------

Different changes to Tiger have caused the release checklist to become
inconsistent.  There are left over steps that no longer need to be followed.  

Design
------

i443.1 Update release.chk to be consistent with Tiger

Issue 524 changed the release script to automatically set the version and build
id of a release.  The steps for manually doing this are therefore removed from
the checklist.

The location for which the release checklists are kept is incorrect in the
checklist.  The location is changed to doc/internal/process/releases/x_x_x,
where x_x_x is the major release version. 

i443.2 Modify release script to create build base directory

Issue 443 documented errors that were seen when the base directory did not exist
at the time of execution.  Currently the release script checks that directories
exist and creates them if necessary.  It is however missing the base directory
for which builds are kept.  This script is modified to check for the top level
releases directory, and create it if needed.

Work Required
-------------

i443.1 Update release.chk to be consistent with Tiger

The changes are made to release.chk according to the design.

i443.2 Modify release script to create build base directory

The changes are made to create_tiger_release.sh according to the design.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------

_- Modify build_base variable in create_tiger_release.sh to equal:
	"${base_dir}/release_test"
_- Modify remote_build_dir to equal: 
    "${remote_build_base}/release_test/${product_version}"
_- Run the release script passing R1_0_0_M6_RC1 as the only argument
_R There are no errors during release creation.
