Tiger Implementation Note
Various nightly build fixes

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes necessary for updating all projects to build
without error during a nightly build.

History

Issue 431

Background
----------

After the original build machine contracted a virus, the nightly builds needed
to be brought up to date.  During the process for bringing them up to date
a few of the projects caused errors during the builds.

Design
------

i431.1	Add compile target to compare

When the compare project was introduced there was no compile target in the build
script.

A new ant target, compile, is added to generate.xml.  This target contains all
necessary classpath entries and a call to the ant javac task.

i431.2 Add nb_all target to ui.properties project

When the properties project was introduced there was no nb_all target in the
build script.

A new ant target, nb_all, is added to generate.xml.  This target depends on all
other targets except format_java.

i431.3 Add compile target to ui.properties

When the properties project was introduced there was no compile target in the
build script.

A new ant target, compile, is added to generate.xml.  This target contains all
necessary classpath entries and a call to the ant javac task.

i431.4 Update classpath entries for dependent projects of ui.properties

When the ui.properties project was introduced the following projects became
dependent on it.

com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas
com.projtech.bp.ui.explorer

Each project's compile target is updated to include ui.properties in the
classpath.

i431.5 Add org.eclipse.ui.views to core's classpath

With the introduction of ui.properties core now depends on the
org.eclipse.ui.views plugin.

The compile target's classpath is updated to support this dependency.

Work Required
-------------

i431.1 Add compile target to compare

The compile target is added as described in the design.

i431.2 Add nb_all target to ui.properties

The nb_all target is added as described in the design.

i431.3 Add compile target to ui.properties

The compile target is added as described in the design.

i431.4 Update classpath entries for dependent projects of ui.properties

The compile targets are updated in generate.xml as described in the design.

i431.5 Add org.eclipse.ui.views to core's classpath

The compile target is updated in generate.xml as described in the design.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------

_- On a test respository run the nightly build.
_R The nightly build completes without any build or compile errors
