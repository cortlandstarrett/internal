Tiger Implementation Note
Remove timeout values before building

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes necessary to the nightly build system for
ignoring build timeout values.

History

final - i436-100104-01.rvm

Background
----------

The nightly builds are constantly failing due to timeout failures.

Design
------

i436.1 Create function for removing timeout entries

A new function, remove_build_timeouts, is added to create_release_functions.sh.
The function iterates through all plugin modules plus MC-Java, calling a sed
command to remove all timeout entries.

i436.2 Call new function in build_modules

A call to the function created in 436.1 is added to the build_modules function.
The call is added before any building occurs.

Work Required
-------------

i436.1 Create function for remove timeout entries

The function is added as described in the design.

i436.2 Call new function in build_modules

This call is added to create_release_function.sh as described in the design.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

During the test run of the nightly builds, a compile error was found.  All
projects that are dependent on ui.properties failed because ui.properties was
built last.  The build order is changed by placing the ui.properties entry, in
the com.projtech.bp.pkg-feature/feature.xml file, above all projects that are
dependent on it.  Since the ui.properties project is dependent on the ui.text
project, the ui.text project is placed before the ui.properties project.

Unit Test
---------

_- Log onto svr-azt-eng-01, using remote desktop
_- Log in as build
_- Open a cygwin shell
_- Change directory to /cygdrive/d/nightly_build
_- Modify the cvsroot variable in create_release_functions.sh
	to point to a test repository
_- Run the create_nightly_build.sh script
_R There are no nightly build errors reported
