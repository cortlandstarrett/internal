Tiger Implementation Note
Upgrade odms model in com.projtech.bp.pkg

Abstract
--------

This note describes the changes for upgrading the odms model.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------

Issue 231

Background
----------

The odms sample model in com.projtech.bp.pkg has orphaned events due to an
export bug in tiger.

Design
------

i231.1 Create a new odms model

i231.1.1 Create a new odms model in BridgePoint using
com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas.test/mdl/odms.bak as a template file.

i231.1.2 Export the model as a sql file with graphics.

i231.1.3 Import the model into tiger.

i231.1.4 Center the scroll position on all charts.

i231.1.5 Export the model, with graphics, to
com.projtech.bp.pkg/sample-models/odms.sql


Work Required
-------------

i231.1.1 Create the new model according to the design.

i231.1.2 Export the model.

i231.1.3 Import the model.

i231.1.4 Set the scroll positions according to the design.

i231.1.5 Export the model from tiger.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The model created on a Dell Latitude D800 left the models off center to the
right on machines with a more conventional screen aspect ratio. The models
were recentered and exported on a Sony PCG-GRV670P.

This only partly solves the problem, because there are many different aspect
ratios in the field. We need to store a boolean to specify that zoom all is
to performed automatically each time the diagram is opened. An issue is
raised to track this requirement.


Unit Test
---------

- Load the newly created model in tiger
- Open the Disk Ownership Class State Chart
- Examine the events on the two transitions into and out of
  'Satisfying Disk Request'
R They are not orphaned
- Open all charts
R All charts have their scroll positions centered.
