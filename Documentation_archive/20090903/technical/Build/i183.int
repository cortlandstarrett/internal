Tiger Implementation Note
Addition of ant compile targets

Abstract
--------

In order for nightly builds to be created and compiled, a compile target for 
each project is required.

History

Document References

Issue 170
Issue 183

Background
----------

Issue 170 introduced a nightly build script which requires all the projects to
have a compile target.

Design
------

i183.1 An ant target is to be added to each project's build script.  The ant
target is named, compile, and contains an invocation of javac.  The ant task,
javac, is run against the src directory of each project and outputs the java
classes to the bin directory.  If the bin directory does not exist the target
creates it.

Work Required
-------------

i183.1 Add the necessary compile target to each projects build script.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------

Complete the following for each project with an ant build script:

- Build each tiger project by right clicking on each project's build script and 
  selecting Run Ant
- Check the all target
- Click the Run button
R The project is built with no errors

Complete the following for each project with an ant build script:
The following test verifies compilation without use of eclipse.

- Build each tiger project outside of eclipse
R Ant throws no compile errors
R The necessary class files exist under the bin directory 
- Start eclipse

Complete the following with each compilation test above:

- Start tiger
R Tiger is started with no errors
- Open the Model Explorer view
R The Model Explorer view is shown
- Import a model from a sql file 
R Contents of the model are shown
- Open each diagram editor
R Each diagram editor is shown with data
- Right click on a function and select New -> Parameter 
R A new parameter, named New Parameter, is created
- Right click on a domain and select Rename.
R The domain name is editable
- Right click on a class and select Delete.
R The class is removed from the view.
- Close Tiger.
