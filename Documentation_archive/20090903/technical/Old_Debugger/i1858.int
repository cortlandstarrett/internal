Tiger Project Implementation Note
Utility to Combine Model Debugger Symbol Table and Debug Log Messages

Abstract
--------

Customers need an easy way to combine Model Debugger symbol tables and debugger
log messages into a single valid XML file so that it then becomes possible to
process the information contained in debug sessions by using XSLT stylesheets.

Background
----------

When Model Compilers create a Model Debugger enabled applications, symbol
table information for each ooa domain in the executable is placed in an xml file
named <domain>.xml.  Debug session information is logged to files named <domain>
_<timestamp>.log.  Neither of these types of files on their own are valid xml
files.  During execution the Model Debugger combines the symbol table and log
information in memory and processes it via XSLT stylesheets to create the
console output.

The Model Debugger User Guide described a utility available for download from
the Project Technology website that would combine symbol table and log session
information so that customers could process the log session information outside
of the Model Debugger.  A search for this utility was unsuccessful.  Either it
never existed or it was lost during the assimilation of the Project Technology
website into the Accelerated Technology website. 

Design
------

1. Utility

 .1 Allow as input a single <domain>.xml file and a single
 <domain>_<timestamp>.log file.
 
 .2 Search the <domain>.xml file for the xml header.
 
 .3 Search the <domain>.xml file for the domain id.

 .4 Replace the domain ids in the log file using the id from the <domain>.xml
 file.
  
 .4 Create a new xml file.  Use the header from the domain file.  Create a root
 element <system> and another element <content> inside it.  Combine the
 remaining information in <domain>.xml file and the log file information inside
 the <content> element of the new file.   Write out the new file.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------


Unit Test
---------

_- Use the utility to combine the symbol table and a log session information for
a Microwave Oven or similar model.

R The utility runs without errors.

_- Process the output of the utility using an XSLT stylesheet. 

R The XSLT processor runs without errors.

R The output from the XSLT processor matches the expected output.
