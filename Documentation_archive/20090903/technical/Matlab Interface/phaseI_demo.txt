This file describes the Phase I requirements for the demo at LMCO that shows
the feasiblility of electronic integration between MATLAB and BridgePoint.

Requirements
------------
1) The demo shall be written on top of the existing Tiger prototype.
2) Sufficient branding shall be done so that Tiger looks like BridgePoint, not Eclipse.
3) Tiger shall allow the user to select an m-file from the GUI that serves as the 
   definition of an operation body.
4) Two modes of bring-up of m-files shall be provided, one that brings up the m-file in the 
   MATLAB native editor, and one that brings up the m-file in a native BridgePoint text 
   editor.  A default mode shall be provided and the user can select the mode that he prefers.
   Both modes shall be shown during the demonstration.
5) Tiger shall store a URL to the selected m-file in the Action_Semantics field. This will be
   output during the export of SQL and hence will be available to any model compiler (this 
   enables the means to satisfy requirement 6 below).
6) During translation, MC-2020 shall query a program with the m-file text and receive C++ in 
   return to be emitted in the generated code.  Since PT will not have access to the Mathworks 
   tool that translates an m-file to C++, we will provide a program that simulates this interface.  
7) PT shall create a BP model for the demo and rely on LMCO to provide the m-file definitions and
   the translated C++.
8) A console window shall be provided that allows the user to access Matlab from within the 
   BridgePoint environment.
9) The demo shall use the Model Debugger as the execution environment.
10)PT shall not attempt to integrate with TVEC.  The TVEC test drivers drive the m-files only and
   this work shall be left to LMCO.
