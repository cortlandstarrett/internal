I wanted to understand more about their current code generation of m
files into ADA.  Here is what Gary said they do today:
  - Use BP archetypes to export and reformat the model information
    (reorder) to get into an Oracle DB.
  - from the Oracle DB they generate their code using Embedded SQL
    calls.  
  - currently they only code gen the OAL in actions.  The transformer
    bodies are already ADA in the models, so they don't currently
    generate code from m-files.  This is the hand translation business
    they want to get away from during 2004.

For Phase II work, they want one of two possible options.  Perhaps we
should give them both:
  1) have a pointer to the m file location that they can access during
     their translation activities
  2) have the actual contents of the m file available for their
     translation.  This removes the extra level of indirection.

  Gary said they would be happy with either of these options.

The phase II work for PT is in the SOW - provide them with the ability
to get to the m files for operations and a pointer to the m file for
translation.  For LMCO the phase II work is to update their parser so
that it can parse m-files in addition to the OAL for states.  Gary
said they will probably have to do this for next year (2004).

Matlab has C++ and C translators, but no ADA translator.  Gary's group
will create a parser for the m files so that they can emit both ADA
and C++.

I told Gary we would try to set up a call today to discuss some things
that Jim wanted to discuss such as getting the demo to Gary before we
show it to his customer.
