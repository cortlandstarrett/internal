Pre conversation summary Campbell/WGT

Here is a summary of what LMCO are currently doing today in their
process.  The are using BP for structure mostly. They have some
classes modeled, and for those classes that have complex data types,
they define a type (base int) and use the type in the model.  If they
need to manipulate the type, the put a comment in the action language
that gets parsed by their code generator.  The comment starts with
//assign and then has raw ADA that manipulates the code.

For transforms, they hand code Ada from m-files and stick the code in
the models.  Then they generate all of the code from their own model
compiler. 

end Pre

Objective for the call set by JDL: Make sure to support Gary to get
the project.  Convince Gary's mgt to give more $ to get stuff into the
project - help LMCO win the project.

Are we going to have the customer or internal folks at the demo?

Gary will contact OSP program people.  When the customer is coming in
we can schedule a demo so the Nasa folks can see it.

1) details about additions to make slicker
2) when we should do internet demo for you
3) timing for demo w/ customer - OSP guys have customer in.  
 *Gary will talk to his guys and find out a date for us

RFP - in November 2003
ATP for final down select, Oct 2004
2 teams
  - LMCO and Northrop Grummond
  - Boeing

Value of our technology -> reduced cost for the project.

xxx - Drop dead date for next year - real time frame
  - PDR by Oct/Nov 2004
  - by PDR have most of the requirements captured
  - have 2 years to have models created - by end of 2006 be finished
Start modeling latter part of 04, early 05.  1-2Q 2005 at the latest
to be able to model.

Gary would like to have some guidance in the report that tells him
what features we could have by what dates.  This may give him some
flexibility in getting some more $.

Jim asked about their language.  Ada or C++, or both - said Gary.  OSP
is heading toward C++ but it is not a requirement.  NorthropGrummond
are a big Ada house.  Nasa is not imposing any language.

(WGT notes)
  - translation of m-files, m-file m^2/parse
  - UI - more complete integration with BP for structures, arrays,
    initialization of these.
(WGT notes)

Demo: 
  Gary: Generate model out of MATLAB code gen.  Generate structure out
  of BP/MC.  Link to an exe, very powerful.  Show execution in MD.
  LMCO can provide a translation of some m-files to C++ with the code
  generator that they have.

  + what we currently have for the demo

Gary likes 2 modes of bring up for the m-file.  MATLAB and native.
The analysts really like to work in the MATLAB env. but a SW engineer
likes to review m-files in the BP env.

Demo: we will show both ways

For the report:
  - additional native capabilities for m-file: syntax highlighting,
  checking, etc. inside of BP along with all of the other features
  that Eclipse gives (bookmarks, etc).  
  - xlate improvements - m^2 of m-file lang.  Take BNF of this
    language and create a parser and populate the m^2 so Gary can
    translate from this instead of their homegrown parser.
  - UI: parameter passing, structures, arrays, initialization

Demo: console window - better to show more integration between the
products. 

For translation, it is more convenient for Gary if during export, we
can get the contents of the m-file and place it directly in the
exported data.  Here are two options:
  - export in SQL
  - generator statement that does this.

tracking the m-file language is not that difficult since it does not
change that much over the years.  They just keep adding more
libraries.

Report:
  - summarize for next phase of work - give enough info in the report
  so that Gary can select which things he wants in the next SOW.
  - Gary will edit the report and fashion a SOW for 2004 work.

-----

Gary just reviewed the new version of BP.  He likes enumerations  -
this is a good thing and they use lots of these.  

They use arrays, matricies, and vectors very much.  They added UDT's
for this, arrays of bools/floats in order to manipulate these in the
tool. 

These guys think in terms of logic: they have an array of indicators,
use to thinking about looping through an array: for i=1 to 10;
a[i]=23; etc. #'ed instances of a particular thing.

Not really a hybrid OAL, but a symbiotic relationship between OAL and
M-file language.

Report is a fishing expedition - good things to do, description and
shopping list.

JDL: Intent of demo
  - show execution of generated code
  - use MD
  - use MATLAB generated code
  - front-end changes w/ both options
  - edit console

TVEC - maybe wire in with demo some how.
m-file -> C++ -> TVEC -> Test case driver for m-files

JDL: Subsequent conversation with Gary:  Budget for next year around
$200k.
