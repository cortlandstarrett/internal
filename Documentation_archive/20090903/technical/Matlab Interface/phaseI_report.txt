This document outlines the requirements for the Phase I report PT 
is writing for LMCO regarding the options in electronic integration between 
BridgePoint and the MATLAB tool.

Whereas the demo provides proof that an electronic integration between MATLAB 
and BridgePoint is feasible, the report will provide Gary Shubert a "shopping 
list" from which he can select the integration(s) he wants based on his budget.  
Those integrations selected will be integrated into the BridgePoint tool suite 
during 2004 and the first part of 2005.

Structure of report
-------------------

As per the SOW, PT shall provide the following information for each of the possible 
integrations:
1) advantages and disadvantages
2) proposed implementation plan
3) schedule
4) cost

Possible Integrations
---------------------
The following integrations have been identified.
1) product strength feature set equivalent to demo support 
2) m-file language support native to BridgePoint (adds syntax highlighting
   and command completion support)
3) m-file translation support (use PT's new rapid parser and langugage meta-
   model development technology to accelerate m-file to Ada code generator)
4) parameter passing
5) user-defined complex data types and matrix declaration and initialization

Report roadmap
--------------
Here are the steps we need to take for each of the integrations:

1) Define the integration and write up an analysis note that describes the integration 
   in as much detail as possible.  The analysis note should identify the advantages and 
   disadvantages and proposed implementation options.
2) Review analysis note in group, revise.
3) Take reviewed note and assign effort estimates in group.
4) Write a report that outlines the integration, advantages/disadvantages, proposed
   implementation plan, and effort estimates. 
5) Deliver report to sales/mkt for input into schedule and cost (based on effort estimates).
   Work with sales/mkt to come up with schedule/cost.
6) Revise report with data from sales/mkt and deliver to LMCO.
