Tiger Project Design Note
Respond to resource changed messages

Abstract
--------
This note discusses changes to the resource change listener to update
Model Explorer when resource changes occur.

History

Issue 767

Background
----------
Changes to resources (branching, introducing files) do not cause the Model
Explorer view to update.

Analysis
--------

The resource change listener ignores CHANGE messages.  The resource listener
is modified to send a model change message that will cause the Model Explorer
tree to redraw when a CHANGE message is recieved.

Additionally, a 'Refresh' menu item is added to the Model Explorer context 
menu.   This menu item will cause the tree to be rebuilt.

Design
------

1. Listen for CHANGE messages

The ResourceChangeListener class is modified to check if the resource change
message is a IResourceDelta.CHANGED message.  The check is added to the 
IResourceDelta.ADDED case, since that case does the complete tree refresh.

2. Add refresh menu item

The ExplorerView class is changed to add the Refresh menu item to its context
menu.  The menu item has the text 'Refresh', tool tip text 'Refresh the tree',
the standard Eclipse refresh icon, and the standard accelerator of F5.   

The menu action performs a workspace refresh, then refreshes the Explorer View
tree.


Design Comments
---------------

Work Required
-------------

1. Listen for CHANGE messages

The test for a delta of IResourceDelta.CHANGED is added to 
ResourceChangeListener.java.

2. Add refresh menu item

The changes are made to create_explorer_view.inc.  The file refresh.gif is
added to core/icons.

Unit Test
---------

- Change to xtUML Modeling perspective
- Create the project ut1 in workspace from repository
R Project created
- Branch the project to 'M8-GBR-i767'
R Project name has branch name added to it
- Select project, choose 'Replace With > Another Branch or Version ...' 
- Select HEAD from wizard, press OK
R Project name has no branch name
- Select project, choose 'Replace With > Another Branch or Version ...' 
- Select branch M8-GBR-i767 from wizard, press OK
R Project name has branch name added to it
- Select 'New > xtUML Model'
- Create domain 'test1'
R Domain is created, project has '>' in name
- Commit domain test1
R Domain is committed, all change indicators are gone

- Open context menu
R Refresh is present
- Select 'Refresh'
R Workspace and tree refreshes
- Press F5
R Workspace and tree refreshes

End
