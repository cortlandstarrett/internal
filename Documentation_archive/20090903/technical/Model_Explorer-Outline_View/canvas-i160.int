Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fix Outline Double Click handler

Abstract
--------
This note describes a fix to the installation of this handler.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue: i160

Design
------
As stated in the issue[1], the selectionChanged handler in
com.projtech.bp.ui.canvas.ModelContentOutlinePage is not the correct
place to install an open listener. This installation is moved to the
hookListeners method. The body of the openListener is implemented as
a call to handleOpen. This brings the behavior of the Outline View
almost into line with the behavior of the Explorer. A test for a non-
null input instance is added in handleOpen to completely align the
behavior of the two views.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
