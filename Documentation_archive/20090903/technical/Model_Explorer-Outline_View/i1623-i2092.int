Tiger Project Implementation Note
1.3.0 release fixes

Abstract
--------
This note describes a few fixes required for release 1.3.0.

Background
----------
The design section contains the background for each issue addressed.

Design
------
1. Set system selection to previously selected items in Model Explorer

Covers [1].

Model Explorer had a selection change listener added, which was believed to get
notified when the Model Explorer part was selected.  While this was true it was
also being notified when ever the system selection was modified.  The listener
was added to address two issues:

1) Model Explorer not getting focus back after giving focus back to eclipse from
   the outside (desktop).
2) The incorrect context menu being shown when right clicking over an element in
   Model Explorer, when Model Explorer did not have focus.
   
The changes made fixed the problems in an incorrect fashion as the behavior
produced by the change was what would be expected if the link with editor button
was set.  While it alleviated the context menu issue and the focus issue it was
the incorrect listener to use.  The correct listener to use is a PartListener,
which handles part activation, and deactivation events.

The part listener is created to set the system selection to that of Model
Explorer's previous selection when the Model Explorer part is activated.  The
system selection is not updated when the link with editor button is pressed as
Model Explorer's selection will already be synchronized with the system's.

2. Start a transaction for creating a state machine

Covers [2]

Currently, when a class is double-clicked an instance state machine is created
if one does not already exist.  A transaction is never started for this creation
and therefore the creation can never be undone.

The code in EditorUtil.java which creates a state machine is changed to start
a transaction before creating one.

3. Restore diagram positions correctly after printing

Covers [3]

The code which handles printing gets the current diagram's positional values as
well as the current diagram zoom.  The values are then restored when a print is
finished.  The diagram's viewport for the x and y axes were being restored in
a switched order, meaning that the x value was restored as the y and the y value
as the x.  This caused the positional values of the diagram to be incorrect
after a print.

The code to restore the positional values in CanvasEditor.java is changed to
restore the values to the correct axes.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
_- Uncheck link with editor
_- Select a few items in Model Explorer
_- Change view to a canvas editor
_- Select an item in the canvas editor
_- Change view back to Model Explorer
_R The selected items in step two are selected
_R The system selection contains the same items

_- Check link with editor
_- Select a few items in Model Explorer
_- Change view to a canvas editor
_- Select an item in the canvas editor
_- Change view back to Model Explorer
_R The item selected in the canvas editor is selected in Model Explorer

_- Double-click a class to create a state machine
_- Select Undo in the context menu
_R The creation of the state machine is undone

(manual test)
_- Open any diagram
_- Print the diagram
_R When finished the diagram remains with its original layout
