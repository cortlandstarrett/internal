Tiger Implementation Note
Operations default to class based and Outline view hides non statics when it 
should hide statics

Abstract
--------
This note describes the steps taken to make operations default to instance based 
as well as fixing the outline view to display the correct members.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue 660

Background
----------
The operations are not initialized to instance based by default and the outline 
view also incorrectly hides the wrong type of operation (i.e. it hides the 
instance based ones not the class based ones).

Design
------
i660.1  Modify Operation.initialize

The class Operation has an attribute named Instance_based which is of type
integer.  Value 1 is instance based and Value 0 is class based.  Add the 
following line in Operation.initialize, so that when an operation is created,
the default is set to instance based:

self.Instance_Based = 1

i660.2  Modify filterStatics in ModelContentOutlinePage.java

The filterStatics logic in ModelContentOutlinePage returns false if
the operation instance is instance based. This is the reason that "Hide Static 
Members" filter incorrectly hides the instance based members instead of the
class based members.  Change it to return false if the operation instance is 
class based as shown below:

if (element instanceof Operation_c) 
{
    return !(((Operation_c) element).getInstance_based() == 0);
}

i660.3  Modify filterStatics in create_explorer_view.inc

Although not mentioned in the bug discussion, even the Model Explorer view hides
the instance based ones incorrectly instead of the class based ones.  This is
due to the same incorrect logic mentioned in i660.2.  Make the change in 
create_explorer_view.inc as shown below:

if (element instanceof ${op.body}) 
{
    return !(((${op.body})element).getInstance_based() == 0);
}

Unit Test
---------
- Create a new operation
R The value for Instance Based Indicator property is "Instance Based."

- In the Model Explorer view, expand the model tree so that the operations can 
  be seen.  Click on "Hide Static Members." 
R Only class based operations are hidden.

- In the Outline view, expand the model tree so that the operations can be seen.  
  Click on "Hide Static Members." A note about how this test is implemented: the
  outline view is accessed by getting a handle to the ModelContentOutlinePage.
  An iteration through the View References is done until the title of the
  View Reference is found to be "Outline." The view is then obtained through
  this view reference, from which the ModelContentOutlinePage is obtained
  through a call to getCurrentPage(). The TreeViewer is then obtained for this
  ModelContentOutlinePage for traversal.   
R Only class based operation are hidden.

- Run All Unit tests
R All unit tests pass.
