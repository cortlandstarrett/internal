Tiger Implementation Note
Fix Model Explorer Rename behavior

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes to make Model Explorer show the correct behavior
when the user changes focus in the tree after initiating a rename.

History

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 931
[2] Bugzilla issue 775
[3] Bugzilla issue 943

Background
----------
The current behavior is inconsistent with the rest of Eclipse. The rename on
lost focus behavior was removed as part of the work for i775[2]. This was done
because there was an observed defect that resulted in the clicked on item being
renamed (i.e the one that was clicked on to cause the loss of focus), not the
one whose name was actually edited.

Design
------
The defect was occuring because we get the Tiger selection to use as the thing
to rename. If editing ended in a loss of focus, the Tiger selection was already
set to the newly clicked on item.

This problem is fixed in the rename action class by restoring the old call to
saveChangesAndDispose() in the Focus listener. Additionally, the originally
observed defect is fixed by changing the statement that obtains the selection in
saveChangesAndDispose from:

IStructuredSelection structuredSelection = (IStructuredSelection) 
                                         Selection.getInstance().getSelection();

to:

IStructuredSelection structuredSelection = new StructuredSelection(selection);

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
An introduced automated test for renaming projects by changing focus fails with
an unexplained race condition. The test passes if a breakpoint is set after the
test is done but before the results are evaluated, but fails if run without a
breakpoint. The test generation archetype in create_action_test.arc was special
cased to remove this one test until we can figure out why this race condition
exists. An issue is raised to track the resolution of this unexplained
behavior[3].

Unit Test
---------
_- Open Model Explorer
_- Click on a tree entry and hit 'F2'.
_- Type a new name.
_- Click on another tree element.
_R The first tree entry has its name changed.
_R The currently selected tree entry is selected but unchanged.
