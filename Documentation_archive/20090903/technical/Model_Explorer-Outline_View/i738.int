Tiger Implementation Note
Model Explorer doesn't filter domain proxies

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to support proxy classes in the Model Explorer
tree for filtering.

History

Issue 738

Background
----------
In Model Explorer, when domains are filtered from the tree, only domains
that are loaded at startup are removed from the tree. 

Design
------
The problem is that the class DomainProxy is the data for the tree item and
not the Domain_c class when a domain hasn't been loaded yet.   Currently there
are many places in the code where there are checks for an instance being either
a Domain_c instance or a DomainProxy instance.  Since we are about to cut a 
release, the simple change is made rather than re-doing the entire design.
The re-do of the design is described in i738.dnt, and the prototype code
is in the Review-i738 branch.

1.  Add handling for proxies to Model Explorer filter code

1.1  A model class has a proxy if its AdapterName is "IFile".  The BuildTree.arc
file is modified to import and execute the get_package function from bp.core.
This function is what sets the AdapterName attribute values.

1.2  In create_explorer_view.inc, we add a check for the AdapterName of the 
class we are generating a filter for.  If AdapterName == "IFile", then we 
generate a check for the class and the proxy for the class matching the
filter criteria.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------

- Start Tiger
- Open a project that has domains
- Select Filters... from the Model Explorer view menu
- Select Domains, press OK
R Domains are not in Model Explorer
