Tiger Project Implementation Note
Locate correct counterpart client instance for imported Subtype connectors

Abstract
--------
This document covers the changes required to correctly pair up subtype
connectors with their Class as Subtype client counterpart instances.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 451

Background
----------
This problem was first observed in the OOA of OOA in the Body subsystem. This
subsystem contains a large number subtypes represented by imported objects. It
was noticed that when some subtype lines were selected, the diagram showed two
subtype connectors as selected, only one of which was the connector clicked
over. This was found to be commutative (i.e. if one subtype line caused
selection of another, clicking on the other would cause selection of the first).
If a subtype line was deleted, both lines (of a pair as described above) would
be removed, but manipulation of a supertypes identifier attribute names showed
that even though the connector was gone, the subtype relationship was still
established in the client meta-model. Finally, yet other subtype lines could not
be selected at all. 

Design
------
When importing BridgePoint SQL data, subtype connectors are assigned a
counterpart instance based on the ooa_id of the participating subtype. The
current strategy assumes that all participating counterpart instances return the
correct ooa id value. For Imported Classes however, this breaks down because the
ooa id of an imported class is not the correct value. The correct value is the
ooa id of the class represented by the imported class symbol.

The ooa id of the imported class symbol will sometimes match another (incorrect)
class by coincidence in the same subsystem. When the match happens with a class
that is a subtype, the pairing behavior described above happens. Sometimes, no
match will be found in the current subsystem and the selection behavior fails
altogether.

The solution is to check during import specifically for imported classes and
navigate to the class instance they actually represent and use the ooa id
obtained from there. This will always pair up the subtype line with the correct
client instance. Since imported classes are the only metamodel entities that
actually represent other entities, no analogous failures are forseen elsewhere.

Work Required
-------------
The changed behavior is required in the method fixUpGraphicalData generated in
the classes ImportBPSql and importModel (this problem would have occurred with
Tiger model files too). The change is made to gen_import_java.inc.

fixUpGraphicalData is required for importBPSQL because the ooa_type values are
set to '-1' for subtypes and associative links. No changes are needed for
importModel because these connectors are given individual ooa_type values by
tiger and can therefore be resolved by the simple call to getinstancefromooa_id
in the common method, setRepresents.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
_- Load ooa of ooa
_- Open the Body Subsystem
_- Select the subtype line associated with the Control class
_R The subtype line associated with the Control class is highlighted
_R The subtype line associated with the Return Stmt class is not highlighted
_- Delete the Control class
_R The subtype line associated with the Control class is deleted
_R The subtype line associated with the Return Stmt class is not deleted

_- Load canvastest
_- Open the Imported Link Class Subsystem
_R The Linked class is shown correctly
_R The link connector can be selected individually.
