Tiger Project Implementation Note
Improve import after editors opened

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to improve import speed after
canvas editors have been opened and closed.

History
-------

final i291-062504-01.rvm

Document References

[1] Bugzilla issue 291

Background
----------

The import speed slows down appreciably after a canvas editor
is opened, even if the editor is closed before the import is
started.

Design
------

The model change and selection change listeners are not being
removed from the listener list when the editor is closed.

i291.1  Remove listeners from selection changed list 

The selection change listener list is maintained
by the Ooaofooa class.  The Ooaofooa.addSelectionChangedListener()
function is called from:

CanvasEditor.hookListeners()
ExplorerView.hookListeners()

The removeSelectionChangedListener() function is only called from
an exception handler in Ooaofooa.  An invocation of 
removeSelectionChangedListener() is added to the dispose() function
in the CanvasEditor and ExplorerView classes.  A data member must
be added to the classes to remember the handle of the created
listener.

The changes are made to CanvasEditor.java and create_explorer_view.inc.

i291.2  Remove listeners from model changed list 

The model change listener list is maintained
by the Ooaofooa class.  The Ooaofooa.addModelChangeListener()
function is called from:

CanvasEditor.hookListeners()
ExplorerView.hookListeners()
ModelContentOutlinePage.hookListeners()
EditorListener.run()

The removeModelChangeListener() function is never called.
An invocation of removeModelChangeListener() is added to 
the dispose() function in the CanvasEditor and ExplorerView classes.  
The dispose() function is created for the ModelContentOutlinePage
class, and the invocation is added.  The EditorListener is never
disposed, so it doesn't need to be changed.

A data member must be added to the classes to remember the handle 
of the created listener.

The changes are made to CanvasEditor.java, ModelContentOutlinePage.java
and create_explorer_view.inc.


Implementation Notes
--------------------

- The code generated for import to validate the Non_Local attribute value
is changed to only update the value if the value is incorrect.  This
reduces the number of model changed messages being sent.

Unit Test
---------

- Start Tiger
- Import odms
- Open class diagram
- Select Disk class in outline view
- Rename to 'TDisk'
R Canvas is updated with new class name
- Close class diagram
- Import odms (again)
R Import takes the same amount of time
- Open class diagram
- Select Disk class in outline view
- Rename to 'T2Disk'
R Canvas is updated with new class name
