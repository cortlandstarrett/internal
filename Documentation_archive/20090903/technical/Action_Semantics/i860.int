Tiger Implementation Note
Fixing Non-removal of Problem Markers After a Parse-All

Abstract
--------
This note describes a fix for a bug where, following a parse-all command,
no-longer-valid problem markers are not removed from actions for which
certain conditions apply.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
Issue 860

Background
----------

Design
------
1.
In bp.ui.text.activity.AllActivityModifier's parseAction() method, the code
is modified so that post-parse saving of the action is not skipped in the 
case where both:

- there's no editor open on the action
- the action had problems before the parse, but has none afterwards

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1.
DuplicateRelationshipNumberParseAllTest was added to the 
bp.ui.text.test.UITextSuite.

2.
In bp.ui.text.test.TextTestUtil, the getMarkers(IFile file) method was 
modified to return an empty result when the given file does not exist.

Unit Test
---------
- open the ODMS subsystem diagram
- add a reflexive relationship R1 on any class C
- right-click on domain node in model explorer, select "Parse All Activities"
R problems appear (in the Problems view) due to the presence 
  of more than one R1 in the domain
- rename R1 on C to R88
- right-click on domain node in model explorer, select "Parse All Activities"
R no problems are left in the Problems view
