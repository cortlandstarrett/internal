Tiger Project Implementation Note
Generate Action Language Processing from BNF

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- The file pt_antlr/antlr/antlr.g was modified to remove
  all nodes from the tree except the ones we are interested in.

- The file err_ee.sql com.projtech.bp.als.oal/sql/err_ee.sql was
  created.   We need to define the Error Reporting external entity
  for use by the action language generation.  The file err_ee_w_graphics.sql
  is used for importing into Model Builder.
  
- The file function_import.sql is used for re-importing into Model Builder.
  It is the same as function.pei.sql, but with the data type definition
  sql present.
 
- The validation function signatures were changed to have the current
  line and column passed in, so that it could be forwarded to the
  error reporting functions.
  
- The rule end function signatures were changed to have the following parameters
  passed to it:  the value returned by the action start function,
  and the value returned by each sub-rule validation function.  This
  is due to the AST not having the line and column information.
  
- Support for one parameter to a rule was added.  The only parameter currently
  needed is for the local_variable rule.  The parameter isLval is 
  true if the variable is being used as an l-value, false otherwise.
  
- Made many changes to the ooaofooa model:

    In the Value subsystem:
      Change identifying attribute to Variable.Var_ID of type unique_id
      Added attribute Variable.Name
      Added attribute Variable.Declared
      Removed attribute Transient Var.Name
      Changed relationship 805 to 1-Mc
      Added relationships 820, 821, 822, and 823
      Added operation Value.clear()  - not fully implemented (depth-first only)
      Added operation Variable.clear()

    In the Action subsystem:
      Added operation Action.clear()
      Added operation Block.clear()
      Added operation Statement.clear() - not fully implemented (depth-first only)
      Added relationships 679, 680
    
    In the Action_Instance subsystem:
      Added operation Create.clear()
      Added operation AssignToTransient.clear()
    
    In the Event subsystem:
      Changed keyletters 'E__CEC' to 'E_CEC'
      Changed keyletters 'E__GEC' to 'E_GEC'

- Implemented the following functions:

  Action_start
  Assignment_expr_end
  Block_start
  Create_object_statement_start
  Create_object_statement_end
  Implicit_assignment_statement_start
  Local_variable_validate
  Object_keyletters_validate
  String_literal_true_validate
  String_literal_false_validate
  Terminal_tok_fraction_validate
  Terminal_tok_number_validate
  Terminal_tok_string_validate
  
- Implemented the unit test using JUnit.  The unit test is in
the file OalParserTest.java.  Also implemented a test program
for debugging a single action: TestParser.java.
 
- antlr/BaseAST.java was changed back to the version supplied
with anltr.  The changes made to the file for the prototype
were no longer needed. Since the unmodified file was never
introduced, the resulting unmodified version is 1.2.

- Updated the tiger_development_env.txt document to describe
adding the oal generation execution.

Unit Test
---------

- Execute generate.bat
- Execute gen_validate.bat
- Execute OalParserTest.java
R All tests pass
