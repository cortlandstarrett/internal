Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fixing Over-Restrictiveness of Spaces in Model Element Names


Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation for fixing a problem introduced by [2]
where spaces are no longer allowed in the names of model elements of types
for which they should be allowed.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 2247
[2] Bugzilla issue 1872
[3] Documentation/internal/technical/Action_Semantics/i1872.dnt

Background
----------
Work done for [2] sought to prevent spaces from being inserted into the names
of model elements of certain types, so as to prevent situations where the 
relocatables functionality might cause the user to have to perform a large
number of manual model element renamings.  Unfortunately, the code that was 
added for [2] disallows spaces in many types on which the relocatables 
functionality has no bearing, and for which spaces should be allowed.  This 
issue is therefore intended to reduce the scope of the code for [2] to only 
impact model element types that are affected by relocatables and are ones 
whose elements should not contain spaces in their names.

Design
------
1. Change specification of which model element types may have spaces

In core's create_rename_action.inc (which generates RenameAction), the
test in the isNameValid() method for whether the model element type permits
spaces is modified to explicitly list those types which do not, rather than
the opposite of listing those types which do, and excluding all the rest.
The types listed are only ones whose names are affected by the relocatables
functionality.

2. Fix ui.properties.ModelElementNameValidator bug

Previously, this validator (which calls the above-mentioned 
RenameAction.isNameValid()) was retrieving the model element to validate
from the current selection.  The validator is changed to take the model
element to validate as a parameter to its constructor.  This is necessary 
since the unit tests which exercise the validator do not set the pertinent 
model element as the current selection.

The line in BuildPropertySource.arc which instantiates a new 
ModelElementNameValidator instance is changed to supply the new parameter.


Implementation Comments
-----------------------
1.  Fix action semantics property cell bug

The work for [2] made the Action_Semantics attribute of activity-containing
model elements derived.  The BuildPropertySource.arc archetype of ui.properties
was seeing this new status and accordingly specifying the wrong kind of 
property descriptor for the attribute, one that would create a cell editor 
without an "..." edit button.  A special case is therefore added to the 
archetype (as well as in the create_view_test.arc archetype of properties.test) 
to ignore the derived status of attributes named "Action_Semantics" when 
determining what kind of property descriptor to create for an attribute.


Unit Test
---------
Perform the same tests as in [3], but also:

- try to rename a model class in the model explorer to contain a space in its 
	name
R the rename succeeds	
- repeat the above for other model element types which allow spaces in 
	the names of their instances
