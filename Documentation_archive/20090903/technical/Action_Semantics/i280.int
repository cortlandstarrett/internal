Tiger Implementation Note
Improve OAL Parser responsiveness

Abstract
--------
This note describes changes to improve the responsiveness of the parser
while the user is typing, especially when typing rapidly.

History
-------

final i280-062204-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
Issue 280

Background
----------

The Activity Editor response time slows noticably when multiple
characters are typed quickly.  For example. when the delete key is
held down.

The activity editor is designed so that each time a character
is typed, the contents of the editor document is reparsed.  The
editor also kills a parse that's running before starting the next parse.
The reason that the editor becomes less responsive is because
the parser thread ignores the interrupt signal, so the thread
isn't killed.  This results in the activity editor waiting for
the parse to complete each time a key is pressed.

Design
------

When the activity editor attempts to kill the parse thread,
it invokes interrupt() on the parse thread, and then waits
for the parse thread to exit.  All interrupt() does is set
the "interrupt status" for the thread.  The parser thread
never checks interrupt status, so it always runs to completion.

i280.1  Change parser to check interrupt status

The parser is changed to check the interrupt status of the
thread just before any validation function is called.  If the
thread has been interrupted, then the InterruptedException 
exception is thrown.  All code for handling the exception is
already in place. This is seen as fine grained enough 
checking, and is easily added.


Work Required
-------------

i280.1  Change parser to check interrupt status

In grammar_enhancer.arc, in each case where a validation
function is about to be called, the following code is added:

if ( Thread.interrupted() ) throw new InterruptedException();

The cases where the interrupt check is added are:

rule begin
rule end
loop begin
loop end
rule reference
string literal
terminal

Implementation Comments
-----------------------


Unit Test
---------

- Run OalParserTest
R Test passes
- Run ParseAllInDomain test
R Test passes
- Start Tiger
- Load odms, open initialize function, press and hold delete 
   key in middle of action
R Characters are deleted with a linear response time
- Add the statement f = "";
- Fill the "" string with characters as fast as possible
R Characters are added with a linear response time
