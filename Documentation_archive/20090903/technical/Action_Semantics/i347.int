Tiger Implementation Note
Change clear() to dispose()

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes to change the clear() operation to
dispose().

Bugzilla Issue 347

Background
----------

The OAL subsystem has operations named clear() that should be renamed to
dispose().

Design
------

1. Rename operations

All operations named clear() in ooaofooa.xtuml are changed to dispose().
Since dispose() operations also delete self, the statement 'delete object 
instance self' is added to the renamed clear() operations.

2. Change all invocations

All invocations of clear() are changed to dispose().  If there is a 'delete
object instance ...' statement following the clear(), that statement is deleted
as well, since dispose now takes care of that.  These changes are made to
ooaofooa.xtuml and function_import.sql.   The following cases didn't have a 
'delete object instance ...' statement after the clear() invocation:

- S_BRG.dispose(), S_SYNC.dispose(), O_TFR.dispose(), O_DBATTR.dispose(),
  SM_ACT.dispose()
  
These cases should have deleted the ACT_ACT instance after calling clear(),
so the code is now correct.  (in other words, this was a bug)

- ACT_BLK.clearCurrentScope()

The code is changed to call clear_blocks to remove all blocks associated with
the action.  This operation is only called if there is a illegal token exception,
so the activity can't be parsed.  At this point we should remove all data for 
the activity.

3. Remove other references to clear()

The archetype create_dispose_tests.arc searches for operations named 'clear'.
This code is removed.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

- Due to the change in clearCurrentScope() to delete all blocks associated with
an action the tests testIllegalStringLiteral() and testIllegalStringLiteral2()
in OalParserTest.java are changed to expect zero instances of the Block class 
to exist.

- Several expected results files in internal.io.sql had to have "Clear" changed
to "Dispose".

Unit Test
---------

- Run all unit tests
R All tests pass
