Tiger Implementation Note
Automate pt_antlr update procces using ant.

Abstract
--------
This note describes automating the update process for pt_antlr using ant.

History
-------

final  i114-021004-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
Issue 114

Background
----------

Currently the pt_antlr jar file needs to be updated manually using
the eclipse interface.  This note explains how to complete these
steps using an ant script.

Design
------

The steps required to update the antlr.jar file include:

    - Compile the java source
	- Remove the old antlr.jar file from pt_antlr
	- Create the new jar file excluding files in the top directory of 
	  the pt_antlr project and all .java files.

i114.1  The ant script contains two targets one called compile and the other
	   update_jar.  Compile will compile all java source under the project
	   directory.  The update_jar target deletes the current antlr.jar file
	   from the project if it exists, then creates a new jar file with all
	   files under the pt_antlr project excluding the files in the directory
	   and all java source files.
	   
i114.2  Update tiger_development_env.txt document to exclude the update jar
		step, unless changing pt_antlr or the antlr.jar file does not exist.    

Work Required
-------------

i114.1  Create the build.xml ant script

i114.2  Update the tiger_development_env.txt as described in the design.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

i114.2  Removed unnecessary steps to toggle antlr nature from the documentation.

Unit Test
---------

Check out pt_antlr as a project.
Remove the existing antlr.jar file.
Remove the existing class files.
Run as an ant build.
Verify that there were no errors in the compilation.
Verify that the antlr.jar file was created.

Code Changes

Introduced version: 1.1
