Tiger Project Analysis Note
Creating Installation Images for Tiger


Abstract

This document describes issues that need to be addressed regarding creating
installation images of the Tiger product.

Analysis
--------

There are two major considerations to take into account when deciding on the
installation program to be used with Tiger.  One is that the Mentor Standard
Installation [1] should be used if at all possible.  The other is that Tiger
should as much as possible have similar look and feel as the Nucleus Edge
product.

In regards to the installation program to be used, these two considerations pose
a dilemma.  At the present time the Edge product uses a Java-based installer
developed at AT rather than the Mentor Standard Installer.   Soon after initial
release the Edge product will be migrated to the Mentor Standard Installer.
Therefore in order to avoid doing double work with the Tiger installation, the
Mentor Standard Installer will be used. 

There are two possible types of install images.  One that creates a standalone
version of Tiger.  Another that consists of a collection of Eclipse plugin
packages that can be unzipped into an existing Eclipse installation.

Configuration options to be considered:
  Server-based installation.  The executables installed readonly on a server,
  each analyst having their own workspace.
  Shall the installer include the Mentor Graphics Licensing System (MGLS).
  Shall the BP6.1 Verifier, Generator and Model Debugger be included in the new
  installer.

Due diligence should be done that proper authority exists to include the
following third party software.  Tiger contains Eclipse, Ant and Antler.  BP6.1
includes ObjectStore, Galaxy.  The Model Debugger includes QT.

The installation package must setup the BridgePoint 6.1 products, Model Builder,
Model Verifier, Generator, and Model Debugger.  This includes setting up the
ObjectStore database server including patching in the schema paths in the Model
Builder, Verifier and Generator executables, the BridgePoint registry key
values, the file structure, including the repository and sample repbin and
libtrans directories.  It also includes the shortcuts to the startup batch
files.
  
The installation package must have the capability of including temporary license
keys for related Mentor products, such as Edge and Calvin, with the permanent
Tiger key. 

Installation images must available for testing by the installation verification
group before release.  Testing should include tests for interactions with other
Eclipse-based Mentor products.

The installation package should install the Mentor Graphics Licensing System
user interfaces, for installing and checking keys, etc.

Consider whether to create new MC-2020 image.  (No licensing changes are
required.)

The installer must detect old installed versions of BridgePoint and take
appropriate actions, display warnings or abort installation.

The installer should install the MicrowaveOven sample model.

The uninstaller should uninstall cleanly.

Should the uninstaller uninstall the BP?   The MC(s)?

Use Cases
----------

1) Install on clean machine

2) Install on machine where a previous version of BP is installed

3) Install on machine where Eclipse is already installed

4) Install on machine where Tiger is already installed

5) Install on machine with existing Mentor products and existing MGC License
Manager

5) Uninstall



Work Required
-------------

i437.1     Due diligence for third party software to be packaged with Tiger.
           Third party software packages include: Eclipse, Ant, Antler,
           ObjectStore, Galaxy and QT.
i437.2     Modify Model Verifier, Generator, and Model Debugger to use the
           Mentor Graphics Licensing System
i437.3     Create new releases of Model Verifier, Generator, and Model Debugger
           that can be packaged with Tiger in the new install image
i437.4     Create an installation images for the Tiger product
    .4.1   Create a standalone Tiger installation image
    .4.2   Create an Eclipse plug-in style installation image
           The installer must be able to check for and warn about possible
           Eclipse version conflicts.
           The plug-in shall be buildable in a form that can be posted on and
           downloaded from a Eclipse plugin server site server.
