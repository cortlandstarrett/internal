BridgePoint Implementation Note
CVS cruft files in release of ui.session


1. Abstract
-----------
Some unnecessary and undesired files (like .cvsignore) are in the ui.session
release.  This note describes how these are cleaned up.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bug 2647.  http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2647

4. Background
-------------
We only want to release the absolutely necessary files, and certainly not CVS
admin files.  This note describes getting rid of some extra files that were in
the released version of ui.session.

5. Design
---------
5.1     Extra files
5.1.1   The released version of ui.session plugin includes the following files
        and directories:
            - .externalToolBuilders/
            - arc/
            - bin/
            - sql/
            - src/
            - .classpath
            - .cvsignore
            - .project
            - build.properties
            - generate.xml
            - plugin.xml
            - session.jar
5.1.2   The following files are the minimal required set:
            - plugin.xml
            - session.jar

5.2     Cause
5.2.1   The build.properties file in the bin.includes line previously contained:
            bin.includes = plugin.xml,\
                           .,\
                           session.jar
5.2.2   The build server reads this bin.includes mark to find out what files to
        copy from the build tree to the release tree.  The ".,\" line caused the
        build server to copy the entire build directory to the release
        directory.  This line simply needs to be removed.

5.3     We need to double-check that this removal will have no adverse effects
        on running BP inside the eclipse debugger.  We also need to double-check
        that the eclipse Export Wizard export of this plugin is not adversely
        affected.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1     I double-checked both items in 5.3 and they are fine.
6.1.1   The eclipse Export Wizard apparently ignores the ".,\" line, as it only
        exported plugin.xml and session.jar, even when that line was in the
        bin.includes mark.

6.2     Because the removed line really needs to be tested as part of a build
        server build, the change has already been promoted to HEAD.  Then the
        build version can be downloaded and verified for correctness.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1     Run the xtUML debugger when BP is launched from inside the eclipse
        development environment.  Verify the Session Explorer still behaves
        as expected.
7.2     Download the build server build with this change in place.  Verify
        Session Explorer still behaves as expected.

8. Code Changes
---------------
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.session (already in HEAD)
    - build.properties

End
