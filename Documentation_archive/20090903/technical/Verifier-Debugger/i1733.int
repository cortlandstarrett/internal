Tiger Project Implementation Note
MV:Engine, passing parameters by reference

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation and code changes needed for passing 
bridge, function, and operation parameters by reference. 

History

Document References
-------------------
[1] BZ issue 1733
[2] Design note: Documentation/internal/technical/Verifier-Debugger/i1733.dnt

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The VM_c class had to be udpated to allow creating a new BPClassLoader when a
system id was passed into the Setuserclasspath method was different than the 
previous system id. This may need to be modified later when paths to multiple 
project paths need to be added to a BPClassLoader. As of now, the BPClassLoader
and VM_c class interactions only support one project path at a time.

Due to changes in the Execution Engine.reset operation, the
testSteppingOnEventQueue method in ExecutionControlTest.java had to be modified
to not make use of the reset method. It was replaced with some code that removes
all Instances in the system.

Stack Frame.dispose was updated to search and remove R942 associations.

 - Passing parameter by reference into realized code. 
Some changes are made in the implemenation of this part of the design. Two 
bridges are added to the Utilities external entity that covert to/from 
BP<data type>s. They are convertToBPDataType and convertFromBPDataType. Any 
parameters passed by reference into realized code will be converted to a 
BP<data type> before using them in the realized code. Once the invocation is
complete the parameters are coverted back to the original data type. These 
changes are in the Bridge Invocation.execute() and Bridge Value.getValue() 
operations.

The various 'instance' utilities in the Utilities external entity are modified
to the original code with the addition of checking for BP<data type> and 
converting appropriately if needed.


Unit Test
---------
The tests described in the design note are implemented in a ParameterPassingTest
class. These tests are added to the verifer test suite. 

Due to issues with MC-3020 update in the verifier branch, the MC-3020 tests were
not ran. This is unlikely to cause a risk. All other junit tests were ran.
