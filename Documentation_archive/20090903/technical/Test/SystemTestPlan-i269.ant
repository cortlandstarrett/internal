Tiger Project Analysis Note
System Test Plan

Abstract
--------
This note outlines the system test plan for Tiger Release 1 (R1).  System test
is above and beyond the system-test-like unit tests we currently perform (and
will continue to perform) for each development issue.

Appendix
--------
Here is a listing of the things we need to test.  It is meant as input to this 
note.  Please add to this list as necessary to make sure we capture everything 
that we need to test for the first release.

- We need to exercise each of the toolbar buttons to make sure they do the
  right things.  
  
- Each of the tests need to check the log to make sure there are no errors 
  and no can't happens.
  
- Testing should be done on a "testing server" and our tests should be able to
  run on the laptops and test servers.  We will have to see if the way we are
  checking images is coupled to a machine, and if it is we should remove
  this dependency.
  
- In order to test our compatibility with the existing BP 6.1 model compilers
  we need to import and export all of the nextgen test models, then translate
  with them.  I am ok with spoofing a repository and creating the ver_data
  and ver_info files from the exported sql file.  Alternatively, we could make
  use of a change to the MC that drives it with an SQL file.  
  
- There are currently no tests to prove that drawing a class/relationship/state
  /transition on a canvas correctly populates the metamodel.

  This should be done in two ways:

  - Use Model Diff to compare a model created with Builder with
    the same model created with Nucleus BridgePoint. The models
    should be logically identical.
  - Generate code from a model created in Nucleus BridgePoint, using
    a number of Model Compilers.

  Japanese Testing
  ----------------
    - Need to test input of all Japanese characters and our working with the 
      IME tool.
