This document describes a group of tools used for coverage testing on java 
applications.

Clover - http://www.thecortex.net

This tool has a nice plugin for eclipse.  The plugin has some faults with it's 
behavior.  Turning coverage compilation off and on requires you to remove all 
the instrumented class files, then rebuild.  Changing the preferences requires 
us to remove the class files and rebuild.  It does not allow you to filter based 
on methods.  All these should be fixed or supported by the end of March 04.

jcoverage - http://www.jcoverage.com

The jcoverage tool eclipse plugin only includes ant support.  You can set the 
class source in junit to the instrumented classes of jcoverage.  This way after 
you instrument the classes you may run junit from eclipse then run an ant target
to generate the reports.  See Campbell's setup.

There are other coverage tools but I believe the above two are most worthy.  If 
you want information on the other tools see Travis.
