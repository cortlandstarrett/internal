Tiger Implementation Note
Fixing a Couple of Bugs in Canvas Test Result Generation

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation of fixes for a couple of bugs 
present when generating expected results for the canvas tests.

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 672
[2] Bugzilla issue 661

Design
------
1.
Issue 661 [2] added an entry for its new CreationTransitionTest to both the 
CanvasTestResultSuite and the CanvasTestResultCreator, when only the latter 
entry was needed.  The entry in the former is removed.

2.
A line             

	Gr_c.cur_canvas = null;

is added to StateChartTest.setup() just before a call to 
Activepoller_c.Oneshot().  Other tests in the canvas result suite (which 
run before the StateChartTests) cause this value to get set to an SWT
canvas which is disposed by the time the StateChartTests are executed, causing 
an NPE during the call to Activepoller_c.Oneshot().  Setting the value to null 
causes the offending code to be skipped, while still allowing the intended 
purpose of the call (to fire a model event) to occur.

Unit Test
---------
The code affected by this issue is entirely within the unit tests, so no
new tests are needed.

- CanvasTestResultSuite is executed
R There are no errors

Code Changes
