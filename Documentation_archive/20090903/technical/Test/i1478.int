Tiger Project Implementation Note
Fixing a RenameTest Failure 

Abstract
--------
This note describes the implementation for a fix for a test failure in 
core.test.RenameTest.testRenameS_SYSWithConflict.

History
-------

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla issue 1478
[2] Bugzilla issue 1190

Background
----------
[2] was promoted even though the test failure was evident.  This was done to 
meet a release date. 

Analysis
--------
One reason why the problem may occur is because a previous test in the suite, 
ActionTest.testDeleteS_SYS(), creates a system named "test" and then immediately 
tries to perform a delete-action on it, without first creating a corresponding 
project for it in the workspace.  Since the delete-action for a system operates 
on the system's project, rather than directly on the system, the delete does
not actually occur, unless some previous test in the suite has created a
"test" project of its own.  If this is not the case (such as when only
the ActionTest and RenameTest tests are run from the suite), the leftover "test" 
system from this test then survives in memory until 
RenameTest.testRenameS_SYSWithConflict() runs, which takes any two systems in 
memory and tries to rename one to the name of the other.  The "test" system
is chosen as one of the two, and the rename is errantly allowed to occur
since the rename action checks only for the existence of a like-named project
in the workspace when determining whether to allow the rename.  Since no "test"
project exists, the rename is allowed, and the test fails.

There is some similar interaction that occurs between 
RenameTest.testRenameS_SYSWithConflict() and one or more of the tests in 
TigerNatureTest.  However, since TigerNatureTest is one of the longer-running
test classes, it would be better to eliminate the interaction by simply
moving it past RenameTest in the test suite running order, as the longer-running
test classes of a suite should come at its end, anyway, to speed debugging of 
the faster ones at the front.

It would also be beneficial to allow any of the test classes up until RenameTest
in the test suite to be able to be run on their own, for the purpose of quicker 
and easier debugging.  

Design
------
1.
Changes are made to core.test.create_action_test.arc to modify the pertinent 
delete and rename tests.

1.1
In the archetype for ActionTest.testDeleteS_SYS(), the test is changed to 
create a "toDelete" project for deletion, rather than attempting to 
delete a previously existing "test" project.  This is done to fix the bug
described in the above analysis.

1.2
In the archetype for RenameTest, explicit mentions of the name of the main 
system and project manipulated during its tests, "testRename1", are changed to 
reference a static member variable holding that name.

1.3
In the archetype for testRenameS_SYSWithConflict(), the test is changed to 
create an extra system in order to ensure there are two present even when the 
rename tests are run on their own.

1.4
In the archetype for testRenameS_DOMWithConflict(), the test is changed to 
create a second model in the system under test, in order to ensure there are 
two present in that system even when the rename tests are run on their own.

1.5
In the archetype for testRenameS_DOMWithInterProjectConflict(), the test is 
changed to create a model in the extra system mentioned above, to ensure its 
presence when testing whether renaming a model in the main system to this 
extra model's name is allowed.

1.6
In the archetype for RenameTest.getDomainSet(), each child of the main system 
is checked to see if it is a domain-proxy, in which case it is replaced by its 
domain, once loaded.  This is necessary because of the creation of the extra 
models mentioned above.

2.
In core.test.CoreTestSuite, the I810_SlowDeletionTest and TigerNatureTest 
classes are moved to after RenameTest in the suite's running order, 
since they both take a long while to complete, and also to eliminate the 
other interaction bug described in the above analysis.

3.
In core.test.I810_SlowDeletionTest, the name of the test project used for its
tests is changed from "test" to "SlowDeletionTest", to prevent possible side 
effects occurring with other core tests that create and manipulate a project 
named "test".

4.
In both core.test.NumberingTest and the archetype for DisposeTest (which is 
create_dispose_test.arc), a call is added at the tests' start to clear the 
model-root they use.  This is to prevent leftover data from previous tests 
from interfering with their operation, and also to verify that the tests may be 
run on their own, without needing other tests to be run first.  

Also, a block in each of these classes that creates a void or integer data type 
is replaced with a call to the newly created 
TestUtil.createMockDefaultDataTypes() method, which creates 
void and integer data types for a given model-root, to be used with a given 
domain. This is useful for tests like these that don't load a model, but 
instead directly create all the model elements they manipulate.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------

Unit Test
---------
The work for this issue involves only changes to existing tests, so no new 
tests are needed.
