Background
----------

As described in the Background section of the Analysis Note [02].

Design
------
Elaborate on each point of the Work Required section of the design note.  
Describe how you implemented each step.

i1018.1 No work required.

i1018.2 Create a model consistency checking tool

     The 'for each object' loop of java.arc was extended to create the two new
     operations for each metamodel class as described in the Work Required
     section of the Design Note [3].  The consistency checks done inside the
     checkConsistency operations are described in detail in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2,
     and 2.3 below.
     
     Several helper functions were added to java.arc to create the Java code
     fragments for the class selectors and  selected class membership test
     criteria.      

     To implement a mechanism for calling the consistency checker, java.arc
     is modified to generate a checkDomainConsistency function.  This function
     is similar to the clearDatabase function except that instead of calling
     each metamodel's clearInstances operation, its checkClassConsistency
     operation is called.  The persist method in EclipseOoaofooa is modified
     to call checkDomainConsistency for the ooaofooa and ooaofgraphics
     domains.
     
     The core utility class, OoaofgraphicsUtil.java was modified to create a
     method for calling the graphics domain consistency checker from the
     ooaofooa domain (from 'persist' as described above).
     
     .2.1 Check for unique identifiers
     
     For each object, a navigation is done to each if its identifiers.  For each
     identifier, a selector is created and the selection is tested for not zero
     and not more than one.
     
     .2.2 Check referring classes
     
     For each object, a navigation is done to its O_RGO's.  A selector is
     created and the selection is tested as described in Design section 2.2 of
     the Design Note.
     
     .2.3 Check referred to classes
     
     For each object, a navigation is done to its O_RTO's.  A selector is
     created and the selection is tested as described in Design section 2.3 of
     the Design Note.
     
     .2.4 Write inconsistency messages to the error log
     
     A helper function called create_test_class_error is added to java.arc to
     create the java code fragment that create an error log entry.
     
     .2.5 Add a process for conditionally including the Consistency Checker
     
     The create_tiger_release.sh script is modified so that if a production
     release is to be built, the environment variable PTC_RELEASE_BUILD is set
     to 'yes'.  Otherwise, it is not set.
     
     Immediately after the check for PTC_MC_ARC_DIR at the top of java.arc the
     variable mc_consistency is set to the value of PTC_RELEASE_BUILD.
     
     All of the Consistency Checker archetype code in java.arc is wrapped around
     checks for if the variable mc_consistency is a null string.  
     
     The generation of the checkDomainConsistency domain function is modified so
     that if mc_consistency is not null, a no-op checkDomainConsistency function
     is created.
     
Implementation Comments
-----------------------

1) A special check was added to the start of generating the checkConsistency
   operations to determine if the target metamodel class is GD_GE.  If it is
   a check is added to assert that the GD_GE.represents attribute is not null.

2) A special supplemental metamodel domain was created in the core.test plugin
   to simplify the unit tests.  The model was named ConsistencyTest.xtuml.  To
   implement the Consistency Test domain, the following supporting files were
   created or modified:
   
   Coloring files Consistency*.clr.
   
   A base class ConsistencyBase, similar to OoaofgraphicsBase was created by
   hand.
   
   The ant build script in core.test, generate.xml, was modified with the extra
   targets necessary to build the supplemental domain.
   
   A unit test class ConsistencyTest was created.  Also, a simple model,
   blankTest.xtuml, to be called by the tests in ConsistencyTest was created. 
   
   The CoreTest class that ConsistencyTest is derived from was modified to
   relax the visibilty of m_logfile_path to make it available to
   ConsistencyTest.

   The ooaofgraphics model was modified to allow the unit tests to run
   successfully.  Association 108 was changed to be conditional.  A
   specification class is not needed if a canvas editor is not open.
   
   CVS ignore files, src/com/mentor/nuclues/bp/core/test/consistency/.cvsignore
   and sql/.cvsignore, were added to cover the new generated files.

   Added Consistency logger entries to bp/core/common/ILogger.java and
   TraceLogger.java. 

   A new unit test in core.test was created, ConsistencyTest.java.

3) A unit test class MCModelConsistency was created in io.mdl.test to perform
   the tests described in part 2 of the Unit Test section of the Design Note.

   This unit test was added to the io.mdl test suite, IOMdleTestSuite.java.

4) Until apparent consistency problems are addressed [04] and [05], a way was
   needed to redirect consistency problems to tracing, rather than the error
   log, in order for existing unit tests to complete successfully.  To support
   this the following files were created or modified:
   
   bp.core/.options
   
   bp.core.test/Test_Readme.txt
   
   ui.canvas/.options

5) Per final review checklist, removed unused dependenices from ui.canvas
   /plugin.xml.

6) Models that had to be introduced in order to allow the unit tests to
   run successfully: Loop Disconnect Telephone.xtuml, microwave.xtuml,
   odms1.xtuml, small.xtuml, small_with_errors.xtuml.
   
7) The original archetype used to test model consistency was factored out of
   java.arc and placed in two files: model_consistency.inc and 
   model_consistency_functions.inc

8) mc_java.depends was modified to include the new archetypes created above
   in 7.
   
9) Due to perfomance issues the checker shall only be enabled if the
   PTC_MCC_ENABLED environment variable is set to true.  It shall never be
   enabled for any release build.
   
Unit Test
---------

-- Execute bp.core.test ConsistencyTest, to perform the tests described in
paragraph 1 of the Unit Test section of the Design Note.

R  The unit test completes without error.  No error log entries are created.

-- Execute bp.io.mdl.test MCModelConsistency.java to perform the tests described
in paragraph 2 of the Unit Test section of the Design Note.

R  The unit test completes without error.  No error log entries are created.
