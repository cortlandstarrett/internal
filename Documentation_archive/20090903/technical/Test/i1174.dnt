Tiger Project Design Note
Enhanced Execution Speed for the Consistency Checker

Abstract
--------

The Consistency Checker created by issue 1018 calls a domain-level function each
time persist is called.  The function checks all model elements to see if they
are populated in the database correctly.  When the Tiger code is instrumented
with these checks it takes too long to do any model operations which call
persist.  For instance drawing a new shape in the ooaofooa model takes about 70
seconds to complete.

Background
----------

As described in the Abstract, the execution speed of the Consistency Checker
created under project 1018 [02] needs to be improved.

Analysis
--------

The calls to the core and canvas domain level consistency checking functions
from the persist() method shall be removed.  In their place a transaction
listener shall be implemented.  The transaction listener shall be built in such
a way as to only check the consistency of model element instances changed during
a transaction.   

Design
------

i1174.1 Remove consistency checking from the persist() method

i1174.2 Implement consistency checking from a transaction listener

Create a transaction listener to be used for consistency checking.  Only check
the consistency of model instances that have changed during a transaction.

Design Comments
---------------

i1174.3 Remove build process option switch used to include or not include the
Consistency Checker

Per the review notes for this document, measurements have shown that the
Consistency Checker has minimal impact on the generation speed and also on the
runtime application.  The build process option switch shall be removed.


Work Required
-------------

i1174.1 Remove consistency checking from the persist() method

i1174.2 Implement consistency checking from a transaction listener

     .2.1 Create a transaction listener named ConsistencyTransactionListener.
     Consistency checking shall be done at the end of each transaction,
     therefore only the transactionEnded method shall contain functionality.
     The method shall contain optimizations to reduce the number of model
     elements that need to be checked.  For example, model elements in
     delete deltas do not need to be checked for consistency.  Also, the model
     elements shall be stored in a java Set.  By default, Sets do not contain
     duplicates.  After all deltas are checked, only model elements remaining as
     members of the Set shall be checked for consistency.
     
     .2.2 Add code necessary to instantiate a ConsistencyTransactionListener in
     the core domain.
     
     The listener shall be instantiated and added to the list of transaction
     listeners in the constructor of EclipseOoaofooa.
     
     .2.3 Add no-op CheckConsistency and CheckClassConsistency methods to
     ModelElement, the supertype of all model element classes.  This will be
     a simple way to assure that these methods exist regardless of if
     consistency checking has been generated into the application or not.
     
     .2.4 Modify the RelationshipChangeModelDelta class to include an access
     method for the source ModelElement as well as the destination ModelElement.
     
i1174.3 Remove the build process consistency checking option switch

     .3.1 Remove the definition of the PTC_MCC_ENABLED environment variable from
     MC-Java/build.xml file.
     
     .3.2 Remove the check for existence of PTC_MCC_ENABLED from java.arc.
     
     .3.3 Remove the conditional inclusion of the consistency checking archetype
     code from java.arc.  Always include consistency checking.

Unit Test
---------

The existing unit tests are sufficient to test the Consistency Checker.

Performance testing should be done.  Measurements shall be made of elapsed time
needed to complete the unit tests.  Elapsed test times with consistency checking
enabled shall not be more than 5% longer than elapsed time with consistency
checking disabled.
