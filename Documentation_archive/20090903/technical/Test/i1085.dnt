Tiger Project Design Note
Factoring out an Oft-Repeated Block of Code in the Canvas Tests

Abstract
--------
This note describes the design for factoring out a repetitive block of code 
from the many canvas test methods in which it appears, into a single place.
The code is used during the validating or generating of canvas test results.

History

[1] Bugzilla issue 1085

Background
----------
The following block of code is essentially repeated throughout the tests 
that are based on ui.canvas.test's CanvasTest class:

	if (generateResults) {
		CanvasTestResult result =
			drawDiagram(
				ce.ptCanvas,
				true,
				false,
				false,
				new Rectangle(0, 0, 1231, 861));
		try {
			writeResults(result.transcript, ce.ptCanvas, result.image);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.err.println(
				"Exception encountered while writing results file " + e);
		}
	} else {
		try {
			doTestDiagram(ce.ptCanvas.getOoa_id(), ce.ptCanvas.getModel_type(), 
				true, false, true);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.err.println(
				"Exception encountered while reading results file " + e);
		}
	}
	
Besides the redundant specifications of this block, another problem is
that, when the code catches an exception, it only writes a message to stderr, 
rather than doing something which signals a test failure.  Thus, there may be 
tests that are reported as passing which are, in reality, not functioning 
properly.

Design
------
1.
The above block of code is captured in a new method of CanvasTest, 

    public void validateOrGenerateResults(Model_c canvas, boolean generate)
    
There is also a new convenience method introduced, 

    public void validateOrGenerateResults(CanvasEditor editor, boolean generate)
    
which simply passes the canvas associated with the given editor to the previous
method.  The code is changed to log exceptions rather than print a message to 
stderr, so that they cause test failures.  

Where the above block of code appears in tests in ui.canvas.test, core.test,
internal.io.sql.test, and io.mdl.test, it is replaced with a call to one of 
these two methods.

Unit Test
---------
The code affected by this issue is entirely within the unit tests, so no
new tests are needed.
