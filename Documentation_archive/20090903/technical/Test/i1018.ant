Background
----------

Late in the development of the first release of BridgePoint 7.0 some defects
were discovered that could cause the metamodel to be populated incorrectly.
Examples of this type of problem are Bugzilla 951 [2] and Bugzilla 995 [3]. 

Analysis
--------

The primary goal of this issue is to build a tool to be used internally for
release testing to confirm the consistency of metamodel populations built using
the BridgePoint Model Builder.  Creating a tool suitable for release to external
customers is a secondary goal.  While the designer of this project is encouraged
to keep the secondary goal in mind, the scope of this project shall be to create
an internal testing tool in a timely manner.

A re-analysis of the metamodel shall be done in order to determine if can be
adjusted in such a way as to minimize the creation of inconsistent populations.
For example, the cardinality and conditionality of each association shall be
examined to assure they are set to optimum values.

A consistency checker shall be created that shall test each element populating a
metamodel.  For each class in the metamodel, each instance of the class shall be
examined to assure that it's identifier is unique and that it participates in
all of the associations of the class in a consistent manner, following all of
the conditionality and cardinality rules of each association.  

The consistency checker shall take into account and allow transient
inconsistencies.  For example it must allow model change listeners to deliver
events or do other processing necessary to make a model consistent.

The consistency checker shall report inconsistencies to the error log.

It is anticipated that running the consistency checker will not consume a large
amount of resources.  Therefore it shall be running and there will be no
mechanism for enabling or disabling it.

One possible design for this project would be to instrument MC-Java by way of
creating checkConsistency operations for each metamodel class that could be
called after each instance creation and after each relate/unrelate.

Another possible design approach would be to use a model change listener to
check consistency after each user-instigated change (or after issue 865 [4] has
been promoted, transaction). 

Work Required
-------------

1) Re-analyze the metamodel as described in the Analysis section.

2) Create a model consistency checking tool as described in the Analyis section.

Acceptance Test
---------------

Create unit tests that programmatically introduce inconsistencies into models
and then check that they are reported in the error log.
