Tiger Project Implementation Note
Enhanced Execution Speed for the Consistency Checker

Abstract
--------

The Consistency Checker created by issue 1018 calls a domain-level function each
time persist is called.  The function checks all model elements to see if they
are populated in the database correctly.  When the Tiger code is instrumented
with these checks it takes too long to do any model operations which call
persist.  For instance drawing a new shape in the ooaofooa model takes about 70
seconds to complete.

Background
----------

As described in the Abstract, the execution speed of the Consistency Checker
created under project 1018 [02] needs to be improved.

Design
------

i1174.1 Consistency check removed from persist() method.

i1174.2 Implement consistency checking from a transaction listener

     .2.1 ConsistencyTransactionListener created as described in the Work
     Required section of the Design Note [03].

     .2.2 Add code necessary to instantiate a ConsistencyTransactionListener in
     the core domain.
     
     Initially the listener instantiation was added to the constructor of
     EclipseOoaofooa.  However, during unit testing it was discovered that
     multiple listeners were created, one for each domain model.  The
     instantiation was moved to CorePlugin.  The archetype
     create_core_plugin_class.arc was modified appropriately. 

     .2.3 No-op CheckConsistency and CheckClassConsistency added to ModelElement
     as described in the Design Note.
     
     .2.4 New method added to RelationshipChangeModelDelta as described in the
     Design Note.
     
i1174.3 Remove the build process consistency check option switch

     .3.1 Removed definition of PTC_MCC_ENABLED environment variable from
     MC-Java/build.xml as described in the Design Note.
     
     .3.2 The check for the existence of PTC_MCC_ENABLED was removed from
     java.arc.
     
     .3.3 The conditional inclusion of the consistency checker archetypes was
     removed.  They are unconditionally included.
     
Implementation Comments
-----------------------

01) During unit testing it was determined that the slow deletion test was
completing with 411 O_RATTRs still in the model.  Modified O_RATTR.dispose
in ooaofooa.xtuml to delete self after doing all the required unrelating.

02) During unit testing it was determined that an inconsistency may be reported
if a formalized supertype part of a super/subtype assocation exists with no
corresponding subtype instances.  This is because the R_RGO side of R111 is
unconditional.  The R_RGO side of the association was changed to be conditional.

03) During unit testing it was determined that inconsistencies were being
reported because many classes in test models had identical key letters.
Key_Lett was a secondary identifier for O_OBJ.  This had previously been
reported as Bugzilla 1093 [04].  Key_Lett was removed as a secondary identifier
of O_OBJ.  In order to do this it was necessary to reformalize the following
associations using Obj_ID instead of Key_Lett: 818, 819, 671, 672, 676, 677,
678, and 670.  In addition, changes were necessary in OalParserTest.java.

04) A collection of 'if's in model_consistency_functions.inc
/create_test_class_select were optimized into a single else-if.  Also added
more entries to the else-if to cover all the elements in the graphics domain.

05) With the move of the consistency checker to a transaction listener,
generating stack traces to accompany each consistency error message now makes
sense.  The error message generating archetype was modified to include stack
traces when error messages are written to the error log.

06) The unit test ModelChangeListenersBatchingTest.testCreateModelElement calls
ActionTest.testNewO_OBJInstanceStateMachine.  Because ActionTests have been
modified to check individual elements, testCreateModelElement has been modified
to disable consistency checking before calling the ActionTest.

07) Replaced expected results for a delete transaction.  This was necessary
because i597 changed many of the model element dispose() operations.   At this
time there is not yet an actual production transaction listener.  The test
Transaction Listener is basically just a logger.  

08) During unit testing it was discovered that many consistency errors were
reported for ActionTests and DeleteTests.  The inconsistencies are not really
errors.  They are artifacts of how the tests were created.   The tests were
created to only test a particular create or delete operation.  Only the minimum
elements needed to test an operation were created.  Thus many models are left
in inconsistent states.  The archetype create_action_test.arc was modified so
that ActionTests check the consistency of the individual relevant components,
rather than the complete model, and the delete tests were modified to turn off
consistency checking completely.

09) Operation tracing messages are generated into the Consistency operations.
Compile errors were occuring in MC-Java.test because that project is not
an eclipse plugin.  Modified the generation of the messages such that if
the project is not an eclipse project the tracing messages are written
to System.out.println instead of Ooaofooa.log.println.

10) During unit testing it was discovered that there may be a race condition
in the canvas project such that a cursor is trying to be set for a canvas that
may already be disposed.  Add a check for if canvas is disposed to 
Setmousecursor in Gr_c.java.

11) During unit testing it was discovered that may be the possibility of an
uncaught InterruptedException in TigerNatureTest in
testConfigurationManagementChangesAllEditorsClose.  Added a try-catch block
to catch that exception.

Note: This change was not made as the method already throws the exception.

12) Added '//$NON-NLS-<#> in several places in ConsistencyTest.java to clear
up some compiler warnings.

13) Added 'TestUtil.sleep(500);' to S_SYS tests generated by bp.core.test/arc
/create_action_test.arc to avoid a possible race condition with the UI
thread.

14) Added note about turning tracing on for io.mdl.test until consistency issues
are resolved.

Unit Test
---------

1) All existing unit tests shall run as expected.


2) Performance test

-- Compare execution time of core unit test with and without consistency
   checking included.
   
R  Consistency checking does not significantly affect the execution speed of
   the unit test.
