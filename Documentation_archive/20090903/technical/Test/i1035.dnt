Tiger Project Design Note

Wizards Tests

Abstract
--------
This note describes the processes necessary to implement a WinRunner Test on
the various wizards of Tiger.

History
-------


Document References
-------------------
[1] Issue 1035
[2] i1035.ant

Background
----------
At this point in time there are no tests for the wizards of Tiger.  To alleviate this
problem a WinRunner test shall be created.

Analysis
--------
see i1035.ant

Design
------
1. Test the Wizards of Tiger through the use of a WinRunner test script.

The test was created along the guidelines of the checklist in i1035.ant.  It follows 
the commands given and checks for all applicable results.    It does this through a
series of various tests and checkpoints.  For buttons and checkboxes it uses GUI
checkpoints, to check a UML diagram it uses a bitmap checkpoint, and to check for
the existence of certain pieces of text, even text that represents a title of a project
 or model, it uses the tl_step command in conjunction with an if statement.

The test is separated into the sections pre-determined by the analysis note. 
Within each section the test will create or utilize a previous piece of data to 
make the components necessary to carryout the test.  When the test is finished 
with a particular component it will delete that component so problems do not
arise the next time the test is run.  In this respect smaller portions of the test may
be rerun if problems arise in a particular area.


Design Comments
---------------

The following test scenario was incorrectly documented in the analysis note:

Description: Tests the export graphics option.

_- Select File > Export
_R The Nucleus BridgePoint Model entry exists
_- Select the above entry
_- Click Next
_R The Nucleus BridgePoint Model wizard is displayed
_R The existing project/model is entered in the Project/Model field
_- Select the Export graphics box
_- Enter an absolute path for the export in a directory which exists
_- Click Finish
_R The file is created at the specified location
_- Import the exported file into Tiger
_- Double click the Domain in the Model Explorer tree
_R Nothing exists on the Domain Package Diagram

The step for selecting the export graphics box should read:
_- Check the Export graphics box

The last result should read:
_R The Domain Package Diagram is displayed and contains all domain elements

The following test shall also be added:

_- Select File > Export
_R The Nucleus BridgePoint Model entry exists
_- Select the above entry
_- Click Next
_R The Nucleus BridgePoint Model wizard is displayed
_R The existing project/model is entered in the Project/Model field
_- Uncheck the Export graphics box
_- Enter an absolute path for the export in a directory which exists
_- Click Finish
_R The file is created at the specified location
_- Import the exported file into Tiger
_- Double click the Domain in the Model Explorer tree
_R Nothing exists on the Domain Package Diagram

Work Required
-------------
1.  A WinRunner test for the various Wizards of tiger that is self sufficient.

Unit Test
---------
To make sure that the test runs correctly any one of the commands from the
checklist may be ignored or executed in a different manner to produce an
unfavorable result.  When the test goes to check for the appropriate result it will
discover the bad one and consequentially fail.
