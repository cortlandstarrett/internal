Tiger Implementation Note
Bad test data in compare.test

Abstract
--------
The test model i424_one.mdl has a bad GD_MD instance for one of its state 
models. This prevents it being opened. This note describes how this problem is 
fixed.

History

Document References
-------------------
[1] Bugzilla Issue 667

Background
----------
The data is bad because it was written with a version of Tiger prior to the fix 
for i620. 

Design
------
i667.1 Change the OOA_Type value of the GD_MD table of the SM_ISM table

There is only 1 instance state chart in the test model.  The first 
INSERT INTO SM_ISM was found, and from that point, the first INSERT INTO GD_MD 
entry was found.  The 4th parameter is the OOA_Type value.  The correct OOA_Type
value was found by checking the OOA_Type entry in another model that is known
to work (for instance, ooaofgraphics.mdl).  The integer 0 is replaced by 40. 

Unit Test
---------
- Manually load the i424_one.mdl and open the instance state chart.  Verify 
  that it opens correctly.
R Instance state chart opens correctly.

- Run all unit tests.
R All tests pass.
