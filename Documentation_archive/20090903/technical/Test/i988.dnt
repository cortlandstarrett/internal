Tiger Project Design Note

Tiger Preferences Tests

Abstract
--------
This note presents the processes necessary to implement a test on the 
Preferences section of the Nucleus BridgePoint Program.

Background
----------
Currently there is no way to test the preferences of the Nucleus BridgePoint
program to ensure that they are working correctly.  This adds a test through the 
use of WinRunner to confirm that they are working right.

Analysis
--------
Currently there is no way to test the preferences of the Nucleus BridgePoint
program to ensure that they are working correctly.  To do this a WinRunner test, 
that uses various checkpoints, is implemented to confirm that when changes are 
made to the program through the preferences menu that they are made to the 
actual program as well.


Design
------
1. Test the preferences section of Nucleus BridgePoint through the use of a 
	WinRunner test script.

Before the test could be created a test model had to be made.  This was done
using the current edition of the Nucleus BridgePoint software and following the 
checklist in release_test.chk under the preferences section.

To test the preferences section once the test model was created, a series of 
bitmap checkpoints was utilized.  Each of these checkpoints would confirm that
a change designated by the checklist was in its default state.  Another
checkpoint would confirm that it had changed after the test script made the
change.  In the end a final checkpoint would confirm that it had returned to its
default status after being reset.

For example, a UML diagram's background color would be checked for default 
status, the WinRunner Script would then change it, the script would check for the
change, the script would return it to default status and again check to make sure it
was in its default state.  This was all done in accordance with the Preferences 
section checklist of release_test.chk.

Design Comments
---------------

Work Required
-------------
All steps required for the test were described in the Design section.

Unit Test
---------
To make sure that the code was working correctly it was intentionally broken so
that it would show an error to simulate the effect of a user defined change in 
preferences not taking effect.  To do this the test code was stopped at a point 
before one of the bitmap checkpoints, the color was changed to the wrong color, 
the checkpoint executed, and consequently failed as it should have.
