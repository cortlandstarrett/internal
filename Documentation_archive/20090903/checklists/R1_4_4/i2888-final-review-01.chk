Checklist
---------
x- If work done under assigned issue introduces a new module/plugin then 
   execute checklist for introducing new modules[1].

x- If work done under assigned issue changes com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core/models
   /ooaofooa.xtuml, execute the doc_final_review checklist [4] to determine if
   user documentation of the Metamodel needs to be regenerated.
   
x- If work done under assigned issue introduces changes to the user
   documentation in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc perform the doc_final_review
   checklist.
   
x- Make sure all files introduced under the assigned issue have the correct 
   ASCII/Binary properties.

x- Remove all code fragments that have been commented out.
   [Tip: While commenting out code during implementation, comment out the code 
         using built in eclipse short-cut key twice to comment or un-comment 
         code. This will put quad forward slashes ////, which will be easy to 
         search for code being commented out]
   
x- All introduced files have standard headers and required footers[2].

x- All applicable coding standards[3] are followed, especially the following:
   . No unused package import statements are left.
   . All warnings given by compiler are addressed where possible.
   . Marks all internal strings as ignorables for Eclipse internalization tool 
     by adding single comments as documented in Eclipse documentation 

     //$NON-NLS-<n>$  where n = 1, 2, 3, ...  The number indicates the position 
     of the string literal on the line, e.g.: 

     assertTrue("1 " + n + "2 " + r),  //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$

     The // is required for each comment
     [Tip: To find these, temporarily check the Option 'Usage of 
           non-externalized strings' to 'Warning' available at 
           Preferences/Java/Compiler/Problems]

x- See if generate.xml file is not left with any unused elements such as 
   targets, variables etc.
   
x- Verify that entries in all .cvsignore files are valid 
   . All explicit files names do not refer to files that should have been in 
     repository.
   . All listed file patterns are very specific and do not leave any chance of 
     future files to being ignored automatically. 
     . Avoid using *.java. Instead use some prefix.
       If files are generated they should have unique file name patterns that 
       can allow them to be differentiated from others.
   . The list does not miss any file that should have been ignored and added to 
     cvs by mistake.

x- All default properties (i.e., those created by wizard) in plugin.xml have 
   been changed to reflect the project properties.
   
x- Verify that the Project dependency list does not contain any extra or 
   un-necessary dependencies. For each project modified:
   . Open the plugin.xml in the Plugin-Manifest Editor
   . Select the Dependencies tab
   . In the Dependency Analysis section in the bottom right corner select
     'Find unused dependencies'.
   . Click OK to remove any that are found.

x- Verify all changes to .classpath are also made to the compile target in
   generate.xml

x- Verify that all hand written (CVS controlled) java files are added to the
   "cvs_java_files" file list for the clean_java target in generate.xml

x- All files are checked-in properly and no file is left ommitted.

o- Verify that all changes specified in design note review minutes were made to 
design note, if present.  If the change wasn't made, there should be an 
explanation in the review minutes.  If there was a major observation, then 
there should be minutes from the re-review, or an explanation for the non-
review in the review minutes.

x- Verify that all changes specified in implementation note review minutes were 
made to implementation note.  If the change wasn't made, there should be an 
explanation in the review minutes.  If there was a major observation, then 
there should be minutes from the re-review, or an explanation for the non-
review in the review minutes.

x- Verify that all work specified in the design note (or in the design section 
of the implementation note), was made to the files specified in the Code 
Changes section of the implementation note. This is done by doing a comparison 
between the initial and final version of the file.  

x- Verify that any changes made to files in the Code Changes section that are 
not traceable back to work required by the design are called out in the 
Implementation Comments section of the implementation note.  

x- Verify that all files mentioned in the design and implementation notes are 
called out in the Code Changes section.

x- Verify that all modules of the project are rebuilt correctly and do not 
result in build errors. This should be done after cleaning the output 
directories.

x- Verify (by thought experiment) that the Unit Test actually tests all work 
  specified by the design and implementation notes.

x- Execute all unit tests and verify that all tests pass and do not result in 
Null-pointer errors. 
[Tip: Null pointer error breakpoints are set from the Breakpoints View, using 
the J! button.]
