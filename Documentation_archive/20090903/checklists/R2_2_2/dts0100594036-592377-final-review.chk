Checklist
---------
o- If work done under assigned issue introduces a new module/plugin then
   execute checklist for introducing new modules[1].

o- If work done under assigned issue introduces changes to the user
   documentation in the MTX doc plugin perform the doc_final_review checklist.

x- All introduced files have standard headers and required footers [2].

x- All applicable coding standards [3] are followed.

x- All files are checked-in properly and no file is left ommitted.

x- Verify that all changes specified in the analysis, design and implementation
   note review minutes were made.

x- Verify that all work specified in the design note (or in the design section
   of the implementation note), was done to the files specified in the Code
   Changes section of the implementation note.

x- Verify that any changes made to files in the Code Changes section that are
   not traceable back to work required by the design are called out in the
   Implementation Comments section of the implementation note.

o- Verify all changes to .classpath are also made to the compile target in
   generate.xml

x- Perform a clean build and verify everything rebuilds successfully.

o- Execute all unit tests and verify that all tests pass.
I can only generate the code, because I do not have a VSI session that is
configured exactly right.
