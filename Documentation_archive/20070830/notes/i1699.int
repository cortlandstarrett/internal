BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Persist action language in the model file

1. Abstract

This note describes how BridgePoint was modified to persist action language in 
the model file.

4. Background
-------------

5. Design
---------
5.1 Modify bp.io.mdl/sql/file_io.pei.sql to include OAL in the data that is 
    persisted.
5.2 Persistence of OAL is done across R601/R666 in the body subsystem.  
5.3 The xtumlmc_build script was modified and xtumlmc_cleanse_for_BridgePoint
    was introduced to it.  This new routine performs 2 tasks:
    -Replace UUIDs with longs
    -Remove any PEI data before processing
5.3.1 BridgePoint build scripts that previously called ReplaceUUIDWithLong
      were modified to call xtumlmc_cleanse_for_BridgePoint instead.

         
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 When the new PEI data was added, there were a couple of places in generated
    code where duplicate variables were encountered.  These were in 
    create_external_link_evaluator.arc, and gen_export_java.inc.  The archetypes
    were modified to prevent these duplicate variable names.
6.2 During initial testing it was observed that proxies were being written
    when navigating between the body and block classes.  This was happening 
    because the code used to determine if elements exist in the same persistable
    model component (NonRootModelElement.java::inSameComponent()) did not 
    properly account for the case(s) where one or both of the PMCs were null.  
    A rouinte named shouldWriteProxy() was introduced.  This new routine 
    determines if a proxy should be written by looking to see if the 2 given 
    elements are not null and if they are in the same component.  This new
    routine is now used in place of inSameComponent() in the export code 
    (gen_export_java.inc).
6.3 The initial implementation introduce the code to populate the R666/R601
    relationship in the activity editor resource listener.  Testing uncovered
    problems with this where a change was made and this resource listener didn't 
    get notified until after persistence happened (which resulted in NPEs and 
    other bad behavior because R601/666 had not been populated with the 
    modified elements before persitence was attempted). Therefore, 
    ModelElementPropertyStorage.setPropertyValue() was modified to cause the
    persitence to occur when OAL is saved.
6.4 In MC-Java/build.xml, the name the file-io-sql target was renamed to
    generate-with-file_io.java.  This was done to address i2746 [4].  Issue 
    i2746 can be closed with this issue.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Ran all unit tests and checked results into [3].
