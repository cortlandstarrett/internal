BridgePoint Project Design Note
Graphics Eye-Candy


1. Abstract
-----------
There is some room to upgrade the "look" of BridgePoint.  These visual
enhancements add a little pizzaz to the tool.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 2951
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com//bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2951

4. Background
-------------
Over time, some of our customers have asked for visual enhancements to the tool.
In addition, some of our competitors, especially IBM Rational Systems Developer,
have very nice looking UI's.

5. Analysis
-----------
5.1		Look for some easy ways we could improve the look of BridgePoint.

5.2		Keep in mind that some users like "eye-candy" while some do not.
		Therefore, we should consider adding some preferences that allow our
		users to control the look and feel to some degree.
5.2.1	At the same time, we do not want a "preference explosion" that adds
		countless checkboxes to control every little nuance of the graphics.

6. Design
---------
6.1		In ui.canvas the file GCDelegate.java provides the interface to the
		drawing of graphics.

6.2		Gradients
6.2.1	In fillRectangle(int i, int j, int k, int l), call Java's
		fillGradientRectangle() function rather than fillRectangle().  This
		will cause all square boxes to be drawn with a gradient.
6.2.2	In fillRoundRectangle(int i, int j, int k, int l, int m, int n), set
		up a Path that defines a rounded-rectangle inside a clipping.  Draw
		a gradient inside this Path.  This will cause state activities to be
		drawn using gradients.
6.2.3	In fillRectangle(Rectangle rect), draw the given rect using a gradient.
		This will cause the canvas backgrounds to be drawn using a gradient.

6.3		Add graphics support functions to manipulate the foreground and
		background, clippings, etc, as necessary.

6.4		Preferences
6.4.1	In "Window > Prefrences" "BridgePoint > Diagram Editors" there already
		exist some visual style preferences for the graphical editors.
6.4.1.1	The "BridgePoint > Diagram Editors" page will have tabs added.
6.4.1.2	The "Colors" tab will contain the selections that are currently on the
		page.
6.4.1.3	The "Enhancements" tab will be added.  This tab will have the controls
		for the user preferences for the new graphical enhancements.

6.4.2	Here are the items we *could* have preferences for:
			- Turn enhanced graphics off
			- Gradient base color
			- Gradient direction
			- Use enhanced graphics on backgrounds
			- Use enhanced graphics on elements

6.4.3	Here are the items we *will* have preferences for on the "Enhancements"
		tab:
			- [Checkbox] Disable gradients
			- <space>
			- [Checkbox] Invert gradient direction
			- <space>
			- Gradient base color [Color selector]

6.4.4	The Diagram Editors preferences page is created in
		bp.ui.canvas/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/ui/canvas/
			preferences/CanvasEditorPreferences.java

7. Design Comments
------------------
None.

8. Work Required
----------------
The work required is specified in Section 6.

9. Unit Test
------------
9.1		All JUnit tests must pass

9.2		Manual tests

9.2.1   Test matrix

        This test matrix describes the various combinations of the options and
        the coverage provided by the following manual tests.

                          |Disable gradients (off)  |  Disable gradients (on)
----------------------------------------------------+------------------------
Invert gradient dir. (off)|          X              |           X
--------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------
Invert gradient dir. (on) |          X              |           X
