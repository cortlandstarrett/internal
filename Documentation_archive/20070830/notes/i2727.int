BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Handle duplicate element names during single file import

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the changes required to keep persistable model components
unique.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bugzilla item 2727
    http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com//bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2727

4. Background
-------------
Prior to PLCM the tool allowed elements with the same name to be created.  With
introduction of PLCM, certain elements cannot have the same name.  This is true 
for elements which are configured as persistable model components.

5. Design
---------
5.1 Modify import code to rename duplicates

The class, bp.core/src/.../ui/NewDomainWizard.java, shall be modified to store a
map of elements based on their class type and the element's name.  This change
shall be made in the persistSelfAndChildren method of the class.  The map shall
be created per child iteration and shall contain all children.

A check shall be added to see if an element with the same class type and name 
exists in the map described above.   If one does exist the element shall be 
renamed to a unique value.  A unique value is defined as a name that does not 
exist in the map.  Once this value is determined the element shall be named as
such.  At this point the element shall be stored in the map. 

After the initial call to persistSelfAndChildren a dialog shall be shown which
indicates that some elements were renamed due to a naming conflict.  We shall
consider storing the renamed elements and populating the dialog with a list of
all elements that were renamed.


6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 The dialog created to report that duplicates were found is titled: 
    "Duplicate Model Elements Renamed".
6.1.1 This dialog tells the user 3 things:
      -The name of the parent where the duplicate was found.
      -The name of the element before it was renamed.
      -The name of the element after it was renamed.
6.1.2 This dialog is displayed one time for each domain that contains 
      duplicates.  Of course if there are no duplicates, the dialog is not 
      displayed.
6.1.3 A screen capture of this dialog is available under this issue's test
      results: <cvs>Documentation/internal/test_results/R1_5_0/i2727/
      DuplicateModelElementsDialog.PNG
6.2 The naming convention used when duplicates are found, is to append 
    "-<incrementing value>" to the duplicate name.

6.3 It was determined that the code for converting single file models needs to
    handle duplicate names as well.  The code actually calls out the newly added
    duplicate handling code.  The problem was that the dialog to a user was not
    being displayed.  The ConvertToMultifileWizard.java class is modified to
    display the dialog if necessary after completion.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 Verify that when a model with duplicate names is imported the new 
    dialog reports the duplicates.  This test was implemented in 
    TigerNatureTest.java::testNewDomainWithDuplicatesInSubsystem().
_- Import bp.core.test/models/Duplicates.xtuml
_R Dialog is displayed and it shows that duplicates were found in the Security 
   subsytem and they were renamed.
   
7.2 Verify that when duplicate class names exist across multiple subsystems they
    are not renamed.  This test was implemented in 
    TigerNatureTest.java::testNewDomainWithDuplicatesInMultipleSubsystems().
_- Import bp.core.test/models/Duplicates2.xtuml
_R Dialog is displayed and it shows that duplicates were found in the Security 
   subsytem and they were renamed.
_R There is only 1 element that was renamed in the TestSS subsystem.
