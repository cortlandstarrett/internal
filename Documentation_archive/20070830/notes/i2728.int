BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Problem with state model imported from BP 6.1


1. Abstract
-----------
Ericsson discovered a problem importing a model into BridgePoint 1.4 that had
been exported from BridgePoint 6.1.  The issue manifested itself by producing
strange behavior on a state machine diagram when the user clicked on the canvas
to select a graphical element.  Most times, BridgePoint would hightlight a
different element than the one selected by the user.

2. History
----------
None.

4. Background
-------------
Users want to migrate models created in BP 6.1 to 1.4.  When a model is exported
in a non-U.S. locale (such as Sweden), real numbers are exported with a ","
where a "." is used in the U.S.  There are just a few locales that use this
notation to represent reals.  Taking into consideration, the installed base for
BridgePoint, we expect the scope of the problem to be quite narrow.

5. Design
---------
5.1     The second to last element in INSERT INTO GD_MD statements has the
        non-U.S. representation of reals.

INSERT INTO GD_MD
    VALUES (524292,
    4,
    151313584,
    1,
    1,
    0,
    1,
    1,
    0,
    12,
    1600,
    4199,
    1,000000,
    0);

vs

INSERT INTO GD_MD
    VALUES (524292,
    4,
    79965,
    1,
    1,
    0,
    1,
    1,
    0,
    12,
    1600,
    4199,
    1.000000,
    0);

        It has been verified that this entry GD_MD "ZoomFactor" is the only
        real value in the entire BP6.1 meta-model (graphics and OOA).

5.2     Create a filter script that can chug through a sql file and convert the
        "," to a "." in the second to last field of "INSERT INTO GD_MD"
        statements.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1     We considered editing the import parser to make BP 1.4 more robust.
        We contacted a customer and they specified no real preference.  So, at
        this point, the filter seems to be the better bang for the buck.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1     Run the filter script on the sample model provided as an attachment to
        [1]
7.1.1   Diff the output SQL file with the input model.
7.1.2   Verify that the only lines changed where the second to last field in
        "INSERT INTO GD_MD" statements.
7.1.3   Verify that the numbers in those lines were changed to use "." where ","
        used to be.  E.g. " 1,000000," => " 1.000000,"
7.1.4   Import the model into BridgePoint, verify the state machine canvas
        behaves as expected in the class "pq".

7.2     Repeat section 7.1 using an input model that has an "INSERT INTO GD_MD"
        statement as the last statement in the file.  (Verifies a special case
        for the filter script).

7.3     Repeat section 7.1 using an input model that already has US-style
        numbers in the field in question. (Verifies the script doesn't mess up
        properly-formatted files).
