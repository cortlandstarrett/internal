4. Background
-------------
none

5. Design
---------
5.1 There are two files marked dirty after a build.  They are:
    -bp/test/common/IDSorter.java
    IDSorter.java is a generated file 
    (from bp.core/arc/create_model_inspector.arc).  However, IDSorter.java is
    not used anywhere.  Therefore, the archetype will be modified to no longer
    generate this file and IDSorter.java will be removed.

    -bp/io/core/sql_insert.g
	This grammar is marked dirty for a couple of reasons.  First, there is an
	explicit "touch" command in the clean target that marks it dirty.  Second,
	it is included in a PTCodeFormat job that may mark it dirty.  The "touch" 
	command will be removed, the file will be removed from the PTCodeFormat
	task, and a dependency will be added on the antrl result (so the touch is
	not needed).


    
6. Implementation Comments
