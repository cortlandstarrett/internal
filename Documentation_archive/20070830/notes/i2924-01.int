BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
New OAL syntax to support Components

1. Abstract
-----------
This note specifies the implementation for supporting Components, Interfaces,
Ports and Signals in OAL.

4. Background
-------------
See [3].

5. Design
---------
See [3]

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 Fixes to the Transition Action Filter
During construction of the test model, it was noticed that the 'Assign Event...'
context menu entry was being disabled when a Signal was assigned to another
transition if only one event was available for assignment. The operation,
Transition.actionFilter() was modified to account for Signals assigned to
transitions.

6.2 Fix Compare Title Bar
This contained a typo 'Bridge Point'.

6.3 Fix to Data Type creation OAL
During construction of the test model, it was noticed that Data types created
locally to a component were not being listed in the data type chooser dropdown
after a restart. This was because the new association R48 was not being set up.
Since persistence was being implemented through this association, the S_DID
instance for the local data type was not being written to file. This was fixed
in the three DataType Package::new*() operations.

6.4 Fix Data Type duplication at the system level
In the properties code, data type packages were searched for and their contents
added to the list. For System level data types, there was code to filter out
Domain level data types. However this filter was based on the component type and
once a Domain was formalized to a Component, the filter stopped working. The
filter was changed so that multiple component types could be specified in the
ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql file. This file was modified to exclude searching
ComponentPackage component types as well as Domains.

6.5 Data upgrades
Data upgrade code was necessary for the Parameter Value (V_PVL) class.

6.6 Placeholder Manager Fixes
Some misleading and mis-spelled error messages were corrected.

6.7 MC-Java schema change
When switching to 1.4.5 plugins, new GD_NCS graphics data was being created. The
MC-Java/ooa_schema.sql file was modified to account for the presence of these.

6.8 Changes to the Models project
A new test model is introduced to the Models project (see below). Models system
level data types are expanded to a the component_ref core type.

6.9 bp.core.test
Issue 2945 introduced bp/core/test/ComponentContextMenuTests.java but did not
include it in the plugin's list of files to exclude from a clean operation (in 
the cvs_java_files property).  It was added.

7. Unit Test
------------
See [3]. All tests were implemented as specified. Some additional tests were
also created. The tests for good syntax are located in a new Model in the
Models project, ComponentSyntaxTest. This model is added to the ParseAllInDomain
test. The same test model is used to provide an environment for the bad syntax
tests which are found in a new JUnit test ComponentSyntaxTest.java.
