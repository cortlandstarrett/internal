Model Compiler Implementation Note
XMI plugin directory changes


1. Abstract
-----------
Investigate and resolve the issue of extra directories being included in the
release of the XMI Export plugin.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] Bug 2559.  http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2559

4. Background
-------------
The XMI export plugin build.properties file includes references to "defaults"
and "build_settings" dirs to be included in the release of the package.
However, these dirs do not appear to actually be part of the plugin.  It looks
like this may be a copy/paste error from one of the MC build plugins.

Since the files are specified in the build.properties file, the build script
creates the directories, but the directories are empty.

Need to investigate if these dirs are really necessary or not and remove them if
not.

5. Design
---------
5.1     When the plugin is build from within eclipse using the "Export Wizard",
        the directories are not part of the output.  Only the plugin.xml and
        xmi.jar files are created.

5.2     The directories in question do not exist in the plugin, so it really
        does not make sense that they are specified in the build.properties
        bin.includes line.

5.3     If the directories are removed (by hand) from the installed version of
        BridgePoint, the XMI export functionality still functions properly.

5.4     The build.properties file will be updated.  The bin.includes stanza will
        change from:

            bin.includes = plugin.xml,\
                           xmi.jar,\
                           defaults/launch_specification/,\
                           build_settings,\
                           build_settings/build_setting.properties

            to:

            bin.includes = plugin.xml,\
                           xmi.jar

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1     Remove the directories from the installer-based installation of BP
7.2     Create an xtUML project, import a model
7.3     Build the project with XMI export turned on
7.4     Verify the <domain>_xmi_2.1.xml file is created

8. Code Changes
---------------
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.xmiexport (R1_4_1-SKB-i2559)
    - build.properties

End
