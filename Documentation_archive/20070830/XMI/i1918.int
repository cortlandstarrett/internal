Tiger Project Implementation Note
Create disabled XMI builder in the eclipse fashion.

Abstract
--------
This note describes the changes required to initially create the XMI builder as
a disabled external tool builder as eclipse expects.

History
-------
final - i1918.int-20060413-01.rvm

Document References
-------------------
[1] Issue 1918

Background
----------
If the XMI builder is created as a non-external builder that is disabled, a
ClassCastException is thrown while working in EDGE.  This has the side effect of
all builders below the XMI builder to not be shown in the project properties.

Design
------
1. Initialize builder as eclipse expects

The configure method of the XMI builder creates the initial builder on project
creation.  This method is changed to create an external tool builder using the
eclipse ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy class.  This class allows the creation
of a launch configuration at runtime.

Eclipse expects the launch configuration to have at least the following
attributes set when the builder is a disabled non-external tool builder:

ATTR_DISABLED_BUILDER
ATTR_BUILDER_ENABLED

The created launch configuration has these attributes set.

Eclipse also requires that the builder be named:
org.eclipse.ui.externaltools.ExternalToolBuilder

The above name is used on initial creation and once enabled is changed to the
XMI builder id.

The tests that check if the XMI builder is enabled in both the mc2020 and the
mc3020 plugins are changed to check only if the name is the value of XMI builder
id.

Implementation Comments
-----------------------
The generate.xml was modified to include the eclipse debug package as a
dependency.

Unit Test
---------
The below tests are performed manually:

_- Create a new xtUML project
_- Create a new domain using the MicrowaveOven as a template
_- Select the Navigator view
_- Select the "Properties" of the project
_- Show the "Builders" page
_R Verify the "XMI Export" builder is unchecked
_R Verify that no builder is missing
_- Close the "Properties" dialog 
_- Build the project
_R Verify the project builds successfully and produces an executable

_- Select the "Properties" of the project
_- Show the "Builders" page
_- Check the "XMI Export" builder
_- Close the "Properties" dialog
_- Build the project
_R Verify the project builds successfully and produces an output file
   	MicrowaveOven_xmi_2_1.xml for the domain in the "src" directory
