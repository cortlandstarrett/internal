* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test. NOTE: This promotion consistently only saw 28 failures, not 48.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"
5) Test Issue. Two failures caused by attempts to run Dissatisfy tests against a
   single domain model.
6) Two known CVS race condition failures. One new file contents comparison
   failure. Two proxy elements were written in a different order. This will not
   affect operation of the tool, but if this result is found to be consistent in
   other workspaces, the expected results should be updated.
7) Known symbol displacement error.
8) 13 failures and one error. The 13 failures are due a reordering of properties
   array contents. The contents are otherwise correct. All these failures are
   present in HEAD so we should go ahead and promote this and look for the
   source of these problems separately.
9) I am currently unable to run this test in my environment.
