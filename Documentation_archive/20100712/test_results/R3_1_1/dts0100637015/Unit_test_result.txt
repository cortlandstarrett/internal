* Notes:
--------
1) No longer carrying known bad tests.  See dts0100656061, dts0100656063, 
   dts0100656066
2) No longer has expected failures.  See dts0100656045.
3) No longer has carrying expected failures.  See dts0100656068.   
4) No longer has expected failures.  See dts0100656058 and dts0100584445
5) Two errors have been seen: testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IP and
   testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IR in recent promotions.  These are 
   not new to the eclipse migration and are ignored.

6) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, there are issues with context menu submenu item lookup.
   CanvasTestSuite: See dts0100656082 
   In Core Suite 2 there are 15 failures because of this.
7) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, test fails due to new LTKLauncher stuff in eclipse's
   DeleteResourceAction. We're not seeing the deletion job come through, so the 
   Canvas for an open System Model isn't closed when the project is deleted.
8) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, possibly 1 error and 13 failures in the property view 
   tests.  This test passed in final review, but not promotion.
9) testInterfaceAssignmentInterfaceContainedInDifferentPackageRoot had one
    small location difference in a model element.
10) Small non-fatal draw location difference in testUnicode
11) There is unexpected errors in Existing Projects test.  Issue dts0100652675 
    is raised to address.
12) 2 test failures in bp.compare.test.HierarchyFileCoverageTest:
    testPEIFileCoverage
    testAttributeCoverageinPEI
    These fail because the expected result contains the new 
    PackabeableElement_c, but the actual result does not.  This problem
    started with the introduction of this element (dts0100631941).  I tried
    adding a EP_PKG with an element in it (an Actor) thinking it would fix it, 
    but it did not.
13) 1 failure from IOMDLTestSuite.test_canvastest
    1 failure from IOMDLTestSuite2.testPersistOAL
    
    These are caused by a compare difference in the S_DT datatypes being 
    created during the test (compare the INSERT INTO S_DT for type 'void' to 
    quickly see the problem).  Prior to issue dts0100631941, the DT_ID was a 
    different type of ID.  It is was previous not a referential, and it now 
    formalizes R8001.  The result is that model update code is handling these 
    datatypes differently.  We are not updating the expected result at this 
    time because in the next stage of dts0100631941 (package 
    un-specialization) we will examine model update.
14) testSpecificationPackageUpgrade sometimes fails with a compare error 
    because order of the CP_CP_PROXY and S_SYS_PROXY are swapped.  
15) 6 CommunicationLink tests are filing because in 
     testFormalizeLinkWithSupertypeSubtype.  The formalize wizard  is
     not popping-up as it should.  This is a test-only problem 
     (verified by manual testing).  Note that tests in this suite
     are dependent on each other, so as soon as one fails so do the others. 
16) 3 failures because ExternalEntity and Function persistence is not 
    properly working since these elements were added under EP_EP.  The failing
    functions are:
    testPackageableElementDisposeExternalEntity
    testPackageableElementDisposeFunction
    testNewEP_PKGFunction
17) This issue has failures introduced with the promotion of the 
    package specialization work.  This issues have not yet been
    fully investigated.  
18) testVerifierCreationTransitionBP fails  "AssertionFailedError", and I had to rerun
     it three times to get this result.
19) Could not find Component  failures.
20) TigerNatureWorkspaceSetup needs to be completely reworked because it depends
    on creating specialized classes in a generalized package. This will cause
    Tiger Nature Existing Projects to fail also.
21) "Actual results differ from those expected" failures due to character format.
22) "Unicode file not loaded correctly" failure.
23) failures cause of  Function / External Entity/ Data Types  packages.
    there is also six "Null Pointer Exception" error and "Index out bound" error
24) 15 Errors
    - Null pointer exception
    - No more hadnles
    - AssertionFailed exception
    - ArrayIndexOutofBounds exception
