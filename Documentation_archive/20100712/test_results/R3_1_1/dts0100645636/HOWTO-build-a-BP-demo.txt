[1] CQ issue dts0100590737
    Provide a licensing solution for the 2009 ET-robocon educational challenge
    Note: This was the issue where we introduced a way to provide a demo 
    version of BP.  The development notes describe the options we examined
    and why we selected the method we did.

How to create a BP demo
-----------------------
x- Determine the demo period.  You will need to know the start date and the end
   date.
x- Create a issue in ClearQuest to track the request for a new demo.   
x- Open a standard BridgePoint development workspace (HEAD) that has been built.
x- Create a new demo key file
	x- Checkout the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator from HEAD in the BridgePoint CVS 
	   repository.
	x- Open the Java perspective   
	x- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and build it 
	  (Project > Build Project)
	xR BridgePointDemoKeyCreator builds with no errors
	x- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and run it 
	   (right click > Run As... > Java Application)
	x- Enter the demo start date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	x- Enter the demo end date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	xR The demo file, BridgePointDemo.txt, is create in the folder that the 
	   MGLS_LICENSE_FILE environment variable points to.
	x- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt created in the previous step to:
	   <workspace>/BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate>
	   where startdate is the YYYYMMDD for the demo start and enddate is 
	   YYYYMMDD for the end of the  demo.
	x- Check in the demo file to the CVS repository

x- Branch the plugins that will be modified.  NOTE!!  This changes will NOT
   be promoted to head.	
	x- Create a branch named Review-<new demo creation issue number> for the 
	   following projects:
	   Note: The changes made here will NOT be promoted to head.
	   model_compilers 
	   com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core
x- Enable the demo license check in bp.core	
	x- "Uncomment" the java code in 
	   bp/core/util/BridgePointLicenseManager.java::checkLicense()
	   that turns on the demo license
	x- Check in the change to the branch
x- Modify gen_erate.exe to allow the binary model compiler to run during the 
   demo period.	
	x- Modify model_compilers/generator/gen_erate/bp_source/win32/7.1B/main/src/gen_erate/main_gen_erate.cc
	   and put in the hard-coded date-check.  To see what this code looks like 
	   compare revisions 1.39.6.5 and 1.39 of main_gen_erate.cc.
	   Note that this change simply wraps the binary 3020 license in a 
	   try/catch block that allows the binary license to work for the specified 
	   (hardcoded) demo period.
	x- Note!!  Make sure you change the 2 hard-coded dates in the above code to
	   reflect the correct demo start and end dates.
	x- check in the change to the branch
	x- Build a new gen_erate.exe
x- Create a branch build for the modified branch	
x- Manually create an installer from the branch build result
   x- The procedure for building an installer is described as part of [2].  
      The same procedure as outlined in [2] is followed except the following 
      files must updated before creating the installer:
       _- Before modifying the BridgePoint installer files, make a back up
       x  on the build server of C:\BridgePoint\BridgePointDeliverables.  
          Restore to this backup after the demo is done being created.
	   x- Replace gen_erate.exe in the install pacakge  with the demo 
	      gen_erate.exe created in the previous step (note that it should be
	      replaced in all its locations).  There are currently 2 locations:
			x- ./eclipse_extensions/BridgePoint/eclipse/plugins/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.dap.pkg_3.1.1/bridgepoint/win32/client/bin/gen_erate.exe			
			   	x- In this location, there is a copy of gen_import.exe and
			       gen_file.exe.  This are simply renamed copies of 
			       gen_erate.exe.
			x- ./eclipse_extensions/BridgePoint/eclipse/plugins/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.mc3020_3.1.1/mc3020/bin/gen_erate.exe			
	   x- Place BridgePointDemo.txt in the license folder 
	      (C:\BridgePoint\BridgePointDeliverables\license) so it will be 
	      installed with the product
_R A demo installer is created
x- Test the installer
   _- If any MGLS* or LM* environment variable exit in the test environment
      comment them out (simply rename them by adding "noForDemo" to their name). 
   _- Install BridgePoint 
   _- Launch the tool
   _R No license errors
   _- Open Help > License Information...
   _- It show  no licenses are present (this is normal for the demo version).
   _- Use the Getting started demo to create MicrowaveOven
   _- Build MicrowaveOven with MC3020
   _R No errors
   _- Launch verifier and run MicrowaveOven
   _R No Errors
   _- Change the system date to 1 day after expiration
   _R License errors appear
   _- Restore the system date and any environment variable that were 
      commented-out in the first step.
   _- FYI (for internal testing), note that after hitting a license error with 
      the demo version the tool will continue to fail (with license errors) 
      until a new, clean, valid,copy of BridgePointDemo.txt is put into the 
      license folder.
