Manual tests
------------
(dts0100598323)
x- Open any model in xtUML modeling
x- Make a change in any OAL to cause a dirty editor (do NOT save the change)
x- From Edge perspective, select the project, and select Run > build 
xR It deosn't prompt asking if dirty buffers should be saved before building
xR Build is successful

(dts0100621060)
x- Create new xtUML project
x- Create new interface
x- Create new operation/signal
xR The value of Basic/Message Direction in the property view will be 
   "To Provider" and "From Provider".

(dts0100636427)
x- Create a new xtuml project
x- Import a model (dogs.xtuml)
x- Launch the Verifier
x- Execute setup() function
xR Make sure that every created instance is shown in Session Explorer
   without any refresh command
x- Repeat The above steps but instead of "Execute setup() function"
   add breakpoint to the oal
x- debug through the oal
xR make sure that every "CREATE" statement is shown in the Session
   Explorer
      
* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-12 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 3 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  - Tree selection not working properly in testLaunchConfigurationTree      
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"
5) Two errors have been seen: testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IP and
   testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IR in recent promotions.  These are 
   not new to the eclipse migration and are ignored.

6) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, there are issues with context menu submenu item lookup.
   In the CanvasTestSuite there is 1 error and 1 failure. 
   In Core Suite 2 there are 15 failures because of this.
7) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, test fails due to new LTKLauncher stuff in eclipse's
   DeleteResourceAction. We're not seeing the deletion job come through, so the 
   Canvas for an open System Model isn't closed when the project is deleted.
8) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, possibly 1 error and 13 failures in the property view 
   tests.  This test passed in final review, but not promotion.
9) Keith got one trivial failure of a location difference of a couple of pixels
   on one element.
10) Keith got one minor test failure where relationship phrases had differences
    in included spaces.    
11) Keith got 2 errors and 22 failures.  The 7 extra failures are due to pixel
    location diffs in the CommunicationMessageTests and the first test in
    CommunicationTests.

Because of the recent copyright change this issue branch was stale.  I am promoting many issue together and want a clean start branch, so I created Review-598323-621060-636427-640143.  I created 598323-621060-636427-640143.int to describe the situation and updated each separate implementation note with a link to the new review branch.

Revision 1.1  2010/01/05 20:08:25  rmulvey
job:dts0100598323 dts0100621060 dts0100636427
Introduced the promotion checklist and moved the issue's development documentation into the R3_1_1 folder to reflect the correct version for the issue's promotion.
