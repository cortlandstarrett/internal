* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-12 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 3 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  - Tree selection not working properly in testLaunchConfigurationTree4)      
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"
5) Two errors have been seen: testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IP and
   testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IR in recent promotions.  These are 
   not new to the eclipse migration and are ignored.

6) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, there are issues with context menu submenu item lookup.
   In the CanvasTestSuite there is 1 error and 1 failure. 
   In Core Suite 2 there are 15 failures because of this.
7) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, test fails due to new LTKLauncher stuff in eclipse's
   DeleteResourceAction. We're not seeing the deletion job come through, so the 
   Canvas for an open System Model isn't closed when the project is deleted.
8) Under Eclipse 3.4.2, possibly 1 error and 13 failures in the property view 
   tests.  This test passed in final review, but not promotion.
 
9) Failures due to character mismatch for drawText() function    
    
10)Unicode file not loaded correctly
