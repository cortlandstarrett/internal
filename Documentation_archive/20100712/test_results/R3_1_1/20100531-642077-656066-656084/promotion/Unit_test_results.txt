* Notes:
--------

Some tests have been removed to allow the tests to complete without
any failures.  The comments below describe the tests that have been
removed.
0 [was 11]) Tiger Nature Workspace Setup and Tiger Nature Existing Projects	 			
    (dts0100668768)
    
	These tests need to be rewritten because of the changes made during 
	the package specialization removal work (dts0100631941). 
	CDM > These tests must be fixed as a matter of priority IMO. Although they
	have not caught a vast amount of failures recently, they test the tool's
    ability to recover its state after a shutdown. As I recall, it was
    introduced to control a growing error cluster of restart issues. I have seen
    restart issues when testing generic packages. I do not think we can survive
    without these for long. Invest what is necessary to get these test running
    correctly and budget to extend them for generic packages.
 
1) MC-3020 Test problem (dts0100656063)
2) Welcome Test problems resolved (see dts0100656066)
3) Verifier Test problems (dts0100656068)
   CDM > These are understood, benign failures except the last one (tree
   selection issue) which is unknown to me. Failure to select can indicate real
   problems with the tree. If it can be shown that this too is benign, fixing
   these tests can be de-prioritized and left till last.
4) bp.als.oal.test problem (dts0100656058 and dts0100584445)
   CDM > RWM has more context on this one.
5) ui.properties.test problems (dts0100656086)
   
   The following tests were failing (sometimes).  So, 
   bp.ui.properties.test/arc/create_view_test.arc was modified to remove them.
   To see the change look for the block marked with the comment:
   .// START: dts0100656086  
   .// END: dts0100656086

   bp/ui/properties/test/PropertiesViewTest.java::testClassParticipant_ImportedClassesProperties
   CDM > I do not have any input to this one without further research.
6) bp.io.mdl.test - IOMDLTestSuite  
    _- dts0100656077.
   CDM > Caused by the optional Packageable element supertype. We should
   consider upgrading all model elements on import to have a PE supertype and
   then change the expected results accordingly. Should be about 1 MD to fix.
    _- dts0100656061
   CDM > I do not have any input to this one without further research.
7) bp.core.test - Core Suite 
7.1) Issues related to dts0100656073 are fixed 
7.2) RTOMove test problems (dts0100656045)
    CDM > TRL can comment on this one, IIRC.
            
8) Compare Test problems (bp.compare.test) (dts0100656072)
8.1) 2 test failures in bp.compare.test.HierarchyFileCoverageTest:
    testPEIFileCoverage
    testAttributeCoverageinPEI
    These fail because the expected result contains the new 
    PackabeableElement_c, but the actual result does not.  This problem
    started with the introduction of this element (dts0100631941).  I tried
    adding a EP_PKG with an element in it (an Actor) thinking it would fix it, 
    but it did not.
8.2) Errors introduced with new CME entries from issue dts0100573206 
      bp/compare/test/cases/GenerateComparisonTextTest.java:testGenerateTextForSQLFile()
      bp/compare/test/plcm/InspectorTest.java:testModelInspector()
    CDM > General comment: Compare is in a MESS! And I am not talking about the
    tests. No doubt some of problems reported by these tests are reflected in
    the observable (mis) behavior of compare. I for one miss its functionality.
    We should do the Right Thing and fix compare first, _then_ revisit these
    tests. No point in fixing tests on known broken functionality.

9) IOMDLTestSuite2 test failures are now resolved.(See dts0100656078) 
    
10) Core Suite II problems (dts0100656069)
10.1) 6 CommunicationLink tests are failing because in 
      testFormalizeLinkWithSupertypeSubtype.  The formalize wizard  is
      not popping-up as it should.  This is a test-only problem 
     (verified by manual testing).  Note that tests in this suite
      are dependent on each other, so as soon as one fails so do the others.
      testFormalizeLinkWithSupertypeSubtype
      testFormalizeLinkWithSimpleAssociation
      testFormalizeLinkWithReflexiveAssociation
	  testFormalizeLinkWithReflexiveLinkedAssociation
      testToggleLinkVisibility
      CDM > Likely a race condition and probably quite easy to pin down. 1 MD.
10.2) Errors introduced with new CME entries from issue dts0100573206
      _- bp.core.test/arc/create_context_menu_tests.arc
         Many CME generated tests were removed.  See the block labeled:
         // START: (consistent menu entries) dts0100573206 test removal 
         // END: (consistent menu entries) dts0100573206 test removal 
      _- bp/core/test/SequenceTests.java::testSequenceInDomainModeling() 
      _- bp/core/test/ModifyNonFullyLoadedModelTests.java/testDeleteClassWithReferringImportedClass    
      CDM > I see large list of removed tests, the last one removed is to do
      with namespacing. It seems like all it needs is a suitable piece of test
      model, so would be easily addressed. However, I do not know if this is
      true of rest of this list (about 25 test cases). Unless they are all as
      trivial to fix as the one I know about this is a significant job to fix.
       
    _- These are not new to the eclipse migration and are ignored.
       testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IP
       testContextMenuDissatisfyActionOnCL_IR in recent promotions.  
       testFormalizeLinkWithLinkAssociation
      CDM > The reasons for these being broken is lost in the mists of time. I
      have no additional input without performing some research.
    
12) io.mdl.test - PKGCM Test Suite Problems (dts0100656080)
12.1) Problems introduced with Eclipse 3.4.2 that are caused by the new 
      LTKLauncher stuff in eclipse's DeleteResourceAction. We're not seeing 
      the deletion job come through, so the Canvas for an open System Model 
      isn't closed when the project is deleted.
