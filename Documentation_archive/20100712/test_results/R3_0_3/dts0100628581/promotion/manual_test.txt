9. Unit Test
------------
9.1 Create xtUML project
	_- select Window->Open->Prospective->xtUML Modeling
	_- Right Click in Model Explorer
		9.1.2.1 select New->xtUML Project

9.2 Add Component and Interface Packages
	_- expand tree ( click on [+] beside project name)
	_- double click on the System Model Package Diagram folder
	_- Add two Component Packages and name it with "Package One" and "Package Two"
	_- Add Interface Package and name it with "General Interface Package"

9.3 Add Interface in "General Interface Package" interface package
	_- double click on "General Interface Package" interface package.
	_- Add new interface and name it with "Global".


9.4 Add two components in "Package One" component package
	_- double click on "Package One" component package box
	_- Add two components and name them with "First" and "Second"
	_- Add Required Interface to "First" component
	_- Add Provide Interface to "Second" component
	_- connect both interface with each other
	_- Right Click on connection (i.e the black line), select Formalize
	_- choose "Global" interface from Formalize form.

9.5 repeat step 9.4 for "Package Two" and name component with "Third" and "Fourth"

9.6 Add unformalized interface between "Third" and "Fourth"
	_- Add Required Interface to "Third" component
	_- Add Provide Interface to "Fourth" component
	_- connect both interface with each other ( do not formalize this one)

9.7 Add two imported components to "Package Two", right click on each one of them
 and select formalize, choose "Package One", select "First" for first imported
 component, and "Second" for the other imported component.
 
9.8 connect both imported components with each other through their interface.

9.9 Right Click on six sides of the interface connections ( two sides in the
formalized component one, another two sides for unformalized component ,and 
finally two sides in the imported component)

_R instead of having "Dissatisfy" label, it should be "Disconnect"

9.10 click on "Disconnect label on all interface connections
_R interface connections should be broken.

9.10 right click on six interfaces
