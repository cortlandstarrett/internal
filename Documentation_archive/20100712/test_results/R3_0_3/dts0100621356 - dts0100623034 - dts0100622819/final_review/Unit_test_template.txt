* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test. NOTE: I consistently see only 28 failures (CDM).
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"
5) I am seeing multiple NPEs running this test. They are coming from code in
core but invariably it is called from the same part of the Properties plugin. If
the Properties View is closed during the test, everything passes. Bob has not
seen this in his environment, so I am accordingly marking this as "Pass'.
6) I see one instance ordering failure. File content is logically identical.
7) I see ten failures, with unexplained labeling differences, also consistent
   could not find component errors.
8) I see the usual graphics translation error.
9) 10 failures with unexplained labeling differences.
10) Not run. Test broken in my environment.
