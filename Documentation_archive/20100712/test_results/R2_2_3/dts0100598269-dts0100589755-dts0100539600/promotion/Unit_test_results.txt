9.1 Test to assure the rcvd_evt and param keywords are interchangeable in an
ISM
x- Create an ISM with 2 states A and B
x- Create a transition from A to B
x- Create an Event E1 with a parameter named P1 which is of type int.
x- Assign E1 to the transition between States A and B
x- Put the following OAL in State B
a = rcvd_evt.p1;
b = param.p1;
if (a == b) and (a == 1)
 LOG:LogSuccess(message:"Param and rcvd_evt values are the same");
else
 LOG:LogFailure(message:"Param and rcvd_evt values are NOT the same");
end if;
xR No parse errors are present
x- Execute the above OAL
xR The param and rcvd_evt values are the same

9.2 Test to assure the send keyword is optional with an interface
signal invocation.
x- Create an interface Package IPkg1 with an interface named interface.
x- In the interface create one signal (sig1) and one operation (op1)
x- Create 2 formal Components (Client and Server)
x- Draw a provided interface from Server, and a required interface from Client,
connect them, and formalize the connection to "interface"
x- In Client, create an ISM with 1 state named A
x- Put the following OAL in state A
send interface::op1();
interface::op1();
send interface::sig1();
interface::sig1();
xR No parser errors are present
x- Execute the code
xR The signal is sent 2 times (with and without the send keyword)
x- Add bridge and class operations with the same names and repeat the test
xR Parser errors are reported for the name conflicts.
x- Test that the send keyword is not allowed for bridges and operations
xR Parser error when send is used with bridges and class operations.

9.3 Verify that unexpected parser errors are handled properly
x- Create some OAL that can cause an unexpected exception during a parse and
contains a syntax error after the unexpected exception.  [SKB: I manually
null-ed out a class in Bridge_invocation_end in the Java debugger to cause the
exception]
x- Parse the OAL
xR Information about the unexception exception is logged
xR The syntax error is reported


* Notes:
--------
1) Broken, untestable until this test is rewritten.
2) Core Suite - RTO Move                                   48 expected errors
   Until issue 3578 is resolved there will be failures for each B12 and B13
   test.
3) com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test                      6-11 expected errors
  The i3099 implementation note explains that some tests will fail until the
  next chunk of work is complete.  There are as many as 11 errors.
  There are 2 kinds of failures:
  - Comparison failure: Default parameter was not as expected...
  - Comparison failure: expected <xxx> actual: <yyy>
       Note that when you look at the differences you see that the expected
       items are present in both cases but they are out of order.  These are
       race conditions.
  -Assertion failure: In debug.engine.VerifierTransitionActionTests, all 3
       tests can have assertion failed errors.  Re-running the test suite
       should get these to go away (bringing the error total from 14 to 11)
4) Five of the TestArray.java AOOB tests fail with the following message:
   "Known issue. See CQ DEI dts0100584445"
5) 2 Errors, NPEs in CME tests testContextMenuDissatisfyActiononCL_IP and
   testContextMenuDissatisfyActiononCL_IR
