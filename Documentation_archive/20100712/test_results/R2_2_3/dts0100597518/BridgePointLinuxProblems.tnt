BridgePoint Technical Note
Provide Linux host support for BridgePoint

Abstract
--------
This note is used to track problems found and fixed while implementing
BridgePoint Linux host support.  This document is being used instead of
the normal issue tracking system because while implement the host support
there are many small problems found and fixed and this document allows
us to quickly manage these problems without the overhead of the
issue tracking system.

When the issue dts0100597518 [1] is complete any open issues remaining in
document shall be put into the ClearQuest issue tracking system.

    Provide Linux host support for BridgePoint



Open issues
-----------
_- dts0100614454: Need an installer
   - Need to create a proper "launcher.bat" and capture required .ini settings
   - Note that when using just a zip file a user must update the
     eclipse.ing and the BP_Launcher.sh files to point to the
     location that the zip file was put in.  By default this is
     /home/bpuser of course the installer will fix this once we have one.

_- dts0100614455: Copy Image functionality has Windows platform-specific code in
   bp.ui.canvas/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/ui/canvas/CanvasTransfer.java.

   Until a platform agnostic implementation is put in place internally we must
   comment this code out in order to self-host under linux.  Of course the
   copy-image functionality we will be broken under linux under this is fixed.

_- dts0100614456: Error in canvas when selecting model elements
	Can't Happen:  Selection Tool state = 2 event = CT_SEL2:Mouse Pressed
	_- Select a transition (or any other type of model element)
	_- Right click
	_- Select the transition (or whtever the model element was) again
	_R BUG
    Note: I verified that this does NOT currently happen in Windows.
		Workaround: Seem to be able to jsut select the item a send time
		and it works.

_- dts0100614457: Moved Model Elements in SeatHeater  SHCtlAlg caused exception
           Note this is a ME under a component

_- dts0100614458: The BridgePoint green-bp.ico icon is not being displayed.  The can be seen
   by opening the canvas for any system-level type and looking at the
   icon in the tab at the top of the canvas (the icon is not present).
   Note: when run under the debugger in linux this works.  Perhaps this is an
   artifact of me exporting my own core plugin for linux.

_- dts0100614459: The pretty background and formatting has been lost on the BP Welcome page.

_- dts0100614460: It appears that the CVS team interface is not behaving well under Linux.
   When I modify files that are under source control I often see errors when
   unfocusing and then refocusing the editor.  The errors seems to come from the
   team interface.  They look like this:

   Resource is out of sync with the file system: '/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.sql/sql/file_io.pei.sql'.

   Similarly, after modifying a file I often see the message:
   The file has been modified on the file system. Do you want to load the changes?

   It acts like there is an auto-save happening or something...


Resolved Issues
---------------
x- Persistence is not working properly (after a restart, can't load model)
   FIX: Modified code that expected to always find a device name (drive letter)
x- Error opening the ISM icon (Note same error for CSM)
		   Can not load the icon: icons/metadata/InstanceStateChart.gif
		   I saw this in the dogs model.
   FIX: There was a case-sensitivity problem in the icon names.  Linux is
        case sensitive and Windows is not.
x- NPE when opening a workspace with open canvases
   FIX: In create_core_plugin_class.arc code was modified to be graceful when
        an icon can not be loaded because of a license failure.
x- There is some kind of startup error in the licensing.  If I have canvases
   open from a prior session it gives me a license error.  If i ignore the
   error and go look at licensing I see that  I have all the licenses.
   I then open the model and it works fine.  It is only a startup error. Perhaps
   a missing dependency?
   FIX: In BridgePointLicenseManager.java
   Fixed a problem that was seen in linux where the very first call to
   INucleusProduct.isLicensed() was failing even though there is a valid
   license. This only happens at startup, and only on the very first call to
   FlexLM.  I simply added a static variable to see if this is the very first
   time in a session that licensing is checked, and if it is and it fails
   simply make the same call a second time.
x- New project wizard isn't working.
   FIX: WizardDelegateChooser.java mc3020NewProjectWizard.java
   MC-3020 extends the com.mentor.nucleus.product extension point
   named com.mentor.nucleus.code-builders.  In the linux implementation
   available choices from that is only "New Code Builder Test Wizard 2"
   where in the full EDGE we also get "EDGE builder" as an option".
   I added a filter so the user never sees this dummy entry.

		    // EDGE has a "dummy" builder implemented "New Code Builder Test
			// Wizard 2".  There is no reason users
  	      	// should have to look at this dummy builder.
		    // However, note that in order for us to ignore it we must also
		    // make sure we ignore it in our delegating wizards that extend the
			// EDGE model-compilers extension point (mc3020NewProjectWizard.java).
x- Getting started doesn't work
   Same fix as New project wizard problem.
x- Verifier execution is not working
   FIX: This was simply configuration a matter of getting the correct plugins into
   the linux system being tested.
x- Model translation is not available (no generator)
   CQ ISSUE: dts0100608014
x- AOOB when component_ref is selected in ME from the system level datatypes.
           Note that this happens in Windows int he current version as well.
   CQ ISSUE: dts0100608825
x- The java in Bob's zipfile is not what I am putting in the installer.  I'm
   putting the JRE in windows, not the JDK.  I planned to do the same for Linux.
   And the zip file java dir is not packaged inside the BP dir, it should be.
   FIX: I added the jre under  the MentorGraphics/BridgePoint folder (just
        like we do in windows) and I updated the eclipse.ini accordingly
        to use it.
x- BP_Launcher.sh does not allow BP to be launched from a link, you must be
   in the same folder as the launch file.
   FIX: added a MENTORHOME="/home/bpuser/MentorGraphics" variable to the
   launcher.  The installer will update this. The user will need to update it
   until we have an installer.
