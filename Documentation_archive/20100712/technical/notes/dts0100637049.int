BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Sort Model Explorer consistently with Navigator.

1. Abstract
-----------
Projects are sorted differently in the Navigator and Model Explorer views.
This note describes the implementation to match the sorting in both views.

2. History
----------
N/A

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] ClearQuest DEI dts0100637049
[2] Path to the sorter: CommonViewerSorter
/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/internal/CommonViewerSorter.java
[3] Path to the sorter: AlphaSorter
/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/core/sorter/AlphaSorter.java

4. Background
-------------
4.1 The Navigator view uses the CommonViewerSorter [2] to sort its elements.
This sorter ignores case on sorting its elements.

4.2 The ModelExplorer view uses the AlphaSorter [3] to sort its elements. This
sorter by default does _not_ ignore case i.e. upper-case letters precede
lower-case ones.

5. Design
---------
The AlphaSorter has a variable "fIgnoreCase" that is set to false by default.
This variable is to be modified to true thus ignoring case when ordering
elements.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
N/A

7. Unit Test
------------
_- Start several xtUML projects and make some of them have names starting with
upper-case letters and others with lower-case
-R The created projects have the same order in both the ModelExplorer and
Navigator views
