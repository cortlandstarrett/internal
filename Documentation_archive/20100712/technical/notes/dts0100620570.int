BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Need better handling for nested elements


1. Abstract
-----------
The document generator doesn't do a very good job handling elements
(specifically canvases of elements) that are nested inside other elements.  This
note describes the changes to make the image grabber and document generator use
the same scheme for nested elements.

2. History
----------
None.

    broken

4. Background
-------------
4.1  The currently shipping version of docgen makes some assumptions about file
     names it expects to come out of the image generator.  For instance, for a
     instance state machine, it knows the ISM is inside a class which is in a
     domain which is inside a system.  It is incapable of handling the case
     where the domain is a component that is nested inside 2 component packages.

4.2  The currently shipping version of the image grabber does have the ability
     to handle some nesting.  There is room for improvement, though as there are
     cases where datatype package images can overwrite each other.  It also does
     not handle all the necessary types.

4.3  The image grabber makes use of a bottom-up approach to nesting traversal.
     This approach is used to build up the list of containing elements travers-
     ing from the subject element up to the containing component.

5. Design
---------
5.1  Change the image grabber to traverse all the way up to the containing
     system instead of stopping at the component.  This will guarantee that all
     canvases are uniquely named and will fix an issue where domain datatype
     packages and system datatype package images overwrite each other when the
     system and the domain have the same name.
5.1.1  This change requires that the image grabber be given the ability to tra-
       verse through domains, components, component packages, element packages,
       and interface packages.
5.1.2  This work is actually part of the ui.canvas GraphicsUtil class and is not
       in the image grabber plugin proper.

5.2  Added functions to the DocGen function package.  Each function handles a
     specific element type from the metamodel.  The caller passes in an instance
     reference to the subject element, the function then determines (from the
     known possibilities) what element is the parent of the subject element.  It
     then adds the appropriate name to the "container list" string, and passes
     the container list string and the parent element instance reference to the
     function for the parent element type.  In this way, we walk backwards up
     through the parent chain from the subject element all the way to the
     system, building the container list string as we go.
5.2.1  The functions added are:
         - getContainerListForA_A()        [Activity]
         - getContainerListForCOMM_COMM()  [Communication]
         - getContainerListForCP_CP()      [Component Package]
         - getContainerListForC_C()        [Component]
         - getContainerListForEP_PKG()     [Package]
         - getContainerListForIP_IP()      [Interface Package]
         - getContainerListForSQ_S()       [Sequence]
         - getContainerListForS_DOM()      [Domain]
         - getContainerListForS_DPK()      [Data Type Package]
         - getContainerListForS_EEPK()     [External Entity Package]
         - getContainerListForS_FPK()      [Function Package]
         - getContainerListForS_SS()       [Subsystem]
         - getContainerListForS_SYS()      [System Model]
         - getContainerListForUC_UCC()     [Use Case]
5.2.2  Of course, the work also changed the docgen_* functions to call these
       getContainerList* functions to get the image name for the associated
       canvas.
5.2.3  docgen_system() did not handle element packages at all, only component
       and interface packages.  Handling for element packages was added.

5.3  Added a README.txt file to the gen folder of the MC-3020 branch of bp.core.
     This file contains instructions for compiling docgen.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1  During development, it was discovered that element Packages (metamodel
     class Package) were not getting properly configured.  The relationship to
     the system across R1405 was not set up.  The problem was that the code to
     set up the relationship was using the relationship itself.  Obviously, this
     won't work.  The following change was made directly to HEAD for
     Package.newPackage():

         - select one system related by self->S_SYS[R1405];
         + select any system from instances of S_SYS
                                  where (selected.Sys_ID == self.getSystemId());

6.2  A workaround was added for a problem that should be investigated further as
     time permits. See [2].

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Create documentation for MicrowaveOven and GPS sample projects.
7.2  Create documentation for any other projects you want.
