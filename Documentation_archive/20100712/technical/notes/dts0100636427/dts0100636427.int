BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Session explorer not showing new instances


1. Abstract
This note is to describe the java code updates in 
com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui so that the Session Explorer
shows the new created instances in oal run or oal statement debugging

2. History
----------


3. Document References
----------------------
[1] ClearQuest DEI dts0100636427 - Session explorer not showing new 
instances.

4. Background
-------------
4.1   Analysis
4.1.1 In "com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.model" package
      It has following classes
      BPThread.java:
		  A thread launched when the verifier is launched and 
		  at the startModel() function is called.  This in turn 
		  starts another thread"runner".  
		  The "runner" thread is responsible for getting a snapshot
		  of the Verifier model "stack", oal code, and actions 
		  execution, and executes it.
		  
		  Calls:
			  BPThread.refreshVerifierViews();
			  BPThread.refreshCanvases();
		  which are responsible for refreshing the Session explorer 
		  and canvas are called after  the "runner" thread is 
		  suspended due to the call
			  fee.wait(); "ExecutionEngine_c waiting"
		  To Obtain a refreshed view in Session explorer fee 
		  "an ExecutionEngine_c instance" needs to be notified 
		  so that the above 2 calls are executed. 
		  However, it  will only be notified when an action occurs
		  on the Verifier.This action occurs as a result of
		  ExecutionAction.execute().
5. Design
---------
5.1  
    IN BPThread.java class 
		another call of
			BPThread.refreshVerifierViews();
			BPThread.refreshCanvases();
		needed to be added before the "runner" thread is suspended 
		due to the call fee.wait(); "ExecutionEngine_c waiting"
	IN BPStackFrame.java class
	    another call of
			BPThread.refreshVerifierViews();
			BPThread.refreshCanvases();
		needed to be added in the end of functions
			stepInto()
			stepOver()

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1
    _- **Note** this is a manual test
	_- Create a new xtuml project
	_- Import a model (dogs.xtuml)
	_- Launch the Verifier
	_- Execute setup() function
	_R Make sure that every created instance is shown in Session Explorer
	   without any refresh command
	_- Repeat The above steps but instead of "Execute setup() function"
	   add breakpoint to the oal
	_- debug through the oal
	_R make sure that every "CREATE" statement is shown in the Session
	  Explorer

7.2
	_- Run Junit tests in  "com.mentor.nucleus.bp.debug.ui.test" plugin 
	_R Tests pass

Because of the recent copyright change this issue branch was stale.  I am promoting many issue together and want a clean start branch, so I created Review-598323-621060-636427-640143.  I created 598323-621060-636427-640143.int to describe the situation and updated each separate implementation note with a link to the new review branch.
