BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
The Canvas CCP ModelRecreationTestSuite has errors for several models.

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the implementation carried out for fixing some failing 
models in ModelRecreationTestSuite.

2. History
----------

3. Document References
----------------------

4. Background
-------------
During promotion of the Review-dts0100631941-dts0100650381 branch the following
models failed in the ModelRecreationTestSuite.
The models that failed are:
self.xtuml
wim3.xtuml
wim4.xtuml
wims.xtuml
wimx.xtuml
yoyos.xtuml

The bp.ui.canvas.test/src/ModelRecreationTestSuite.java was modified and the 
above models were removed from the test.
This issue is raised to resolve the problem the caused this and put these model
back into the test.

5. Design
---------
5.1 After trying to reproduce the errors in the models, it seemed that they 
were already fixed.

5.2 ModelRecreationTestSuite
The work done in this class to remove the failed models should be reverted.
The 'removedFordts0100674278' String that include all models that used to fail 
was removed.
The part of code inside accept() that excludes the models inside 
removedFordts0100674278 was be removed.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------

7. Unit Test
------------
_- Run CanvasCCPTestSuite with the models that used to fail.
_R 0 errors 0 failures.
