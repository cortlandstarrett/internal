4. Background
-------------
Currently we use the words client and server (where server refers to the
provider of the interface) in the value of the property indicating message
direction on interfaces.So our aim is to change this terminology to something 
that makes the direction obvious.

5. Design
---------
5.1 IFDirectionType
  5.1.1 The data type of the message direction is an enumeration data type 
        called "IFDirectionType" with two enumerator "ClientServer" & 
		"ServerClient",third one called "Bidirectional" will be added
		later by issue [2].
  5.1.2	The description of each enumerator will be the following
    5.1.2.1  "Value: 0
              Full Name: To Provider"  for ClientServer enumerator.
    5.1.2.2  "Value: 1
              Full Name: From Provider"  for ServerClient enumerator.	
  5.1.3 The message direction in the property view of component interface takes
        its value from the "Full Name" in the description of each previous 
		enumerator. 			  
5.2 There is another related work will continue with issue [3]. 			  
			  
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------


7. Unit Test
------------
7.1
_- Create new xtUML project
_- Create new interface
_- Create new operation/signal
_R The value of Basic/Message Direction in the property view will be 
   "To Provider" and "From Provider".

Because of the recent copyright change this issue branch was stale.  I am promoting many issue together and want a clean start branch, so I created Review-598323-621060-636427-640143.  I created 598323-621060-636427-640143.int to describe the situation and updated each separate implementation note with a link to the new review branch.
