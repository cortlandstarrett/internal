BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
MC-3020 Help contents is not linked up correctly.


1. Abstract
-----------
Online help for mc3020 has a glitch - index shows a chapter for Model Debugger -
which does not exist. Thereafter, contents are out of synch with index which 
results in 'topic not found' for many subtopics.

2. History
----------
None.

3. Document References
----------------------
[1] ClearQuest DEI dts0100644716
[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100617106


4. Background
-------------
4.1 The Help Content of BridgePoint is generated from ".xml" files that contain
    the content of chapters and appendices 
4.2 The ".html" files are generated using "xsltproc.exe". 
4.3 The "toc.xml" file is generated using "xsltproc.exe", it controls the 
    tree view part of the Help content.
    

5. Design
---------
5.1 Check out the folder MC-Documentation from the head 
5.2 Use "xsltproc.exe" to generate html files and corresponding 
    plugin.xml and toc.xml


6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 The help contents in the BridgePoint release are not the same as the 
    output generated from the  files in the folder MC-Documentation in the head.
6.2 Using the same files in the folder MC-Documentation in the head and the 
    "xsltproc.exe" generated the ".html" files with the correct content 
     -no Model Debugger chapter- and the corresponding toc.xml file shows 
     a consistent tree view for the help.


7. Unit Test
------------
_- Check out the folder MC-Documentation from the head 
_- Open a command prompt.  
_- cd to MC-Documenation\external\mc3020\ug\xml\
_- Then run: xsltproc.exe --nonet --novalid ug.xsl ug.xml
   This will generate the html files from the xml and a corresponding 
   "toc.xml" file.
_- From windows explorer navigate to 
   C:\MentorGraphics\VSx_Dev\eclipse_extensions\BridgePoint\eclipse\plugins
   \com.mentor.nucleus.help.bp.mc_3.0.2
_- In the "doc.zip" folder replace the html files with the generated ones.      
_- Replace toc.xml and plugin.xml with the generated ones 
_- Start Vxs_Dev and navigate to 
   Help >Help Contents >BridgePoint MC-3020 Model Compiler User's Guide
_- Navigate through the tree view part 
R- There are no glitches 

8. Code Changes
---------------
None.
