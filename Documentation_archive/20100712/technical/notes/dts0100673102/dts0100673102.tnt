BridgePoint Technical Note
GEF graphics cleanup (parent issue)

1. Abstract
-----------
This note is used to track observations about the GEF graphics being introduced 
with issue dts0100650381 [2].  Capturing observations here allows us to quickly 
push through initial observations and decide later which should be fixed 
immediately and which should have separate issues raised.  When this issue is 
promoted any problems remaining in the Observation section should be raised in 
CQ.

    GEF graphics cleanup (parent issue)
[2] ClearQuest DEI dts0100650381
    Support GEF based graphical editor

Background
----------
GEF-based graphics are being introduced in BP v3.1.1 by issue [2].  
After initial promotion to head is complete a test phase shall start.  
This issue is raised as a "parent issue" for all observations about 
the new graphics.  During development, this allows us to quickly add 
observations about the GEF graphics to a design note and later create 
break-out issues as needed.

Intended Audience
-----------------
This is for BP team members testing with BP v3.1.1 (the internal engineering 
release that contains GEF graphics).

1. Observations
---------------
priorities listed as:  gate, high, med, low, no
done marks items that are implemented.
 
1.1 [11:32:29 AM | Edited 11:32:46 AM] Bob: I am just noticing that in GEF, 
    when selecting any model element that has floating text associated with it, 
    the floating text and the model element are not shown as selected together 
    (though the CME entries ARE correct for both).   It looks a little weird.
    [11:34:18 AM] Travis London: We could select both.  Let's add it as something 
    to look at after this promotion.
done

1.2 When you open a new Subsystem, the tools to draw classes and associations 
    are not immediately visible in the palette.  You first have to click the 
    "Classes" button (see Keith for pic) It would be nice if this was expanded 
    automatically instead of collapsed when you open this diagram.
done
    
1.3 Anything created from the explorer(right click on the component -> new) is 
    created at the right bottom corner of the canvas(at the end of the screen) 
done (remaining problems will be addressed with the promotion of the reconciler
      work)

1.4 In the state machine, you can not create a transition from & to the same 
    state (self transition).
done

1.5 Provided & required interface (connectors) can be drawn anywhere in the 
    "component diagram", without causing a resize of the component container
    symbol.
low
TRL: Just need more time to fix, last attempt was not successful.

1.6 Class can be pasted in a DataType package
	_-Create Project
	_-Create SubSystem
	_-Create Class 
	_-Right click the class and select "copy"
	_-Double click on DataType Package without clicking on the canvas
	_-Ctrl+V
	R-The class is drawn on the DataType Package
low

1.7 When Deleting a project the Open Editors of it are not closed but they still
    show white rectangles with red "X" marks on it in the editors
    _-Create Project
    _-Create packages
    _-Show them in editor
    _-Right Click on the Project > "Delete"
    _-The Editors are still there and have white rectangles with red "X" marks
done
    
1.8 New "Imported Component" instead of "Component Reference"
    _-Create Project
    _-Create Component package
    _-Right click on the canvas >New 
    R-The first item in the new menu is "Imported Component" // should be 
                                                             Component Reference
done
    
1.10 Two different interfaces can be connected even if the provided and required 
     interface are formalized on different interfaces 
     
_-Create New >xtumlProject "Test" 
_-RightClick on "Test" New>Interface Package "TestInterfacePackage" 
_-RightClick on "TestInterfacePackage" New>Interface "interfaceOne" 
_-RightClick on "TestInterfacePackage" New>Interface "interfaceTwo" 
_-RightClick on "Test" New>Component Package "ComponentPackageOne"  
_-RightClick on "ComponentPackageOne" New>Component "ComponentOne" 
_-DoubleClick on "ComponentOne" 
_-Draw "Provided Interface" 
_-Navigate to "Test">"ComponentPackageOne">"ComponentOne">Port1>Unnamed Interface 
_-RightClick on "Unnamed Interface" >"Formalize" formalize it on "interfaceOne" 

_-RightClick on "ComponentPackageOne" New>Component "ComponentTwo" 
_-DoubleClick on "ComponentTwo" 
_-Draw "Required Interface" 
_-Navigate to "Test">"ComponentPackageOne">"ComponentTwo">Port1>Unnamed Interface 
_-RightClick on "Unnamed Interface" >"Formalize" formalize it on "interfaceTwo" 
_-On the canvas of "ComponentPackageOne" connect the provided and required interfaces 
R-They get joined together which should not happen because they are formalized 
  on different interfaces       
done
 
1.11 From Bill: The ordering of "New > <elements>" does not coincide with the 
     most common tasks being at the top.  The ordering should be improved.
     - Also, "SubSystem" should be "Subsystem", or perhaps even renamed to 
       "Class Diagram" to aid new users
high
TRL: This and number 1.13 need to be specified better, it is not necessarily a
     direct issue of graphics.
      
1.12 From Bill: Can the palette be a view by default?  That way it is more
     movable and detachable from the beginning without having to go make it a 
     view first. Or perhaps provide a context menu for the palette "Detach" that
     automatically makes it a view and detaches it. Decide on proper behavior
     and document how to switch between view and non-view attached palette.
done
     
1.13 From Bill: The "Default" drawer in the palette often does not contain the
     most common tasks a user would like to perform.  Those are often in the 
     difficult to find (see 1.2) specific drawer like "Components" or "Classes"
med
     
1.14 From Bill: Can we supply big icons for the palette's "Use large icons" 
     feature. Then the user could choose large icons and no text and get a side
     toolbar with big icons.
med
     
1.15 From Bill: It would be good to allow the palette to be made into a toolbar
     that is completely horizontal.  Right now, the drawers always stay 
     vertical.
low (next)
TRL: I suggest we do nothing about this, if horizontal is wanted than the user
can use the palette view.
     
1.16 From Bill: Can we make Toggle Grid available in the context menu of the 
     canvas?  And make it global instead of diagram by diagram. It should not
     be in the global View menu if it isn't global.
high
TRL: I do not think a global action in the view should be used, maybe a global
     preference.  Regarding the View menu we can remove it, but none of the
     actions there are global (in the sense that they only affect the current
     diagram).
     
1.17 From Bill: The component package tab in the canvas is wierdly proportional
     to the width of the element on the canvas.
low
TRL: Will need suggestions here.
     
1.18 From Bill: Can we get rid of the useless tabs at the bottom of the canvas
     like "Graphical Editor" that are meaningless everywhere but state machines?
     They eat up valuable real estate on laptops.
med
TRL: Not sure how easy it will be, but I agree that they should only be present
     when necessary.  I will look into it.
    
1.19 From Bill: Can the zoom dropdown be made to show the whole list instead of 
     just 5 items?
done
     
1.20 From Bill: Description hover is not working for packages, only classes.
done

1.21 From Bill: Would like to have individual coloring on elements of his
     choosing.
med 
TRL:  This will come when moving to GMF, if desired before than it will be a
      decent amount of work.
     
1.22 From Bill: When editing inside an unformalized component canvas, the 
     component edge needs to stay constant around the edge of the canvas.  
done
     
1.23 From Cort: An idea...when we hover over an interface, make the tooltip show
     messages with direction.
med (if easy)

1.24 From John: De-selection of drawing tool.  I don�t like the automatic
     de-selection of the drawing tool after a shape has been drawn.  I like the
     ability to drop several components, subsystems, classes, or states into
     place with the default size just be clicking once for each shape.
done
     
1.25 From John: Categories on palette.  When I first opened a class diagram, the
     drawing palette did not change as I expected it to do.  It took me a few
     seconds to locate the �classes� folder way at the bottom of the palette.
done

1.26 From John: Moving Shapes.  I like the new approach of leaving the shape in
     its original place while indicating the new location with a shaded
     rendition of the shape until the move is complete.  However, we�re
     currently missing the connectors during the move.  We need to represent the
     connectors as the shapes are being moved.
med

1.27 From John: Resizing Shapes.  Same comment as for moving.  I also like the
     well-defined resizing points when a shape is selected, allowing the user to
     change one or both dimensions.  I like having the ability to resize
     multiple shapes with a single operation.
med (will be fixed with 1.26)

1.28 From John: Back and Forward.  Back and forward (similar to web browser
     buttons) make little sense in this context.  However, we desperately need
     better navigation, including something like �go up to parent�.  I have
     documented the navigation needs in an issue.
no

1.29 From John: Scrolling.  It�s a little weird that you cannot scroll the
     canvas until you have elements outside the visible canvas.  It�s a bit
     inconvenient to be forced to drag elements little by little out into the
     area that you want to put them.  I find myself dragging an element off the
     visible canvas and then scrolling over to it, and then repeating the
     process until I have the element where I want it on the canvas.  Then I
     realized I could zoom out and drag a group of elements to another part of
     the canvas and then zoom back in to work on them.  I suppose I could get
     used to this paradigm, but it still seems a bit constrained.
done
     
1.30 From John: Zoom.  I like having some pre-determined zoom levels, but I
     don�t like being limited by them.  I miss all the zoom buttons from the old
     canvas editor.
med (if buttons are wanted we can add them)
     
1.31 From John: Connectors.  Drawing connectors is not exactly smooth.  When you
     click the first shape there is a disconcerting flash of the connector
     before you start moving the mouse.  It just feels weird and buggy.
no (cannot fix until we have bendpoint creation during connector creation)
     
1.32 From John: Bending.  The original line bending approach was really cool,
     but I know that some customers found it non-intuitive.  If you right click,
     you don't get the expected (arcane) "add point", so there is no visual clue
     that you can just bend the line anywhere you like.  The approach certainly
     provides the necessary visual clue, but it's not nearly as cool as the old
     approach.
no (We will get this on a move to GMF, if wanted it would take some time)

1.33 From John: Grid.  It's silly to force the user to activate the view of the
     grid to get snap-to-grid behavior for drawing.  These two concepts should
     be separate.  And, the snap-to-grid behavior in this version is not nearly
     as nice as the original.  I think the grid resolution is a little too fine
     or the tolerance that determines when you are close enough to produce a
     snap is too small.  In short, we've taken a step backward in terms of
     making it easy to draw models that look good.  I've always wanted the
     ability to select a connector and get options like "align to grid" and
     "square angles".  We should also be able to select shapes and get
     "align to grid".
high
     
1.34 From John: Palette.  The palette consumes a fair bit of screen real estate,
     but most of our customers are using large screens these days, and it's
     really nice for those of us with 40+ year-old eyes to be able to read the
     names of the tools without the need to hover over each symbol incrementally
     until we find the one we want.  I like being able to move the palette to
     either side of the canvas, but it would also be nice if we could put it on
     the bottom or the top.  Being able to put the palette in a view is really
     nice.
low (same as 1.15, add capability for horizontal placement)
     
1.35 From John: Sequence Diagrams.  We still need to do a lot of work here.
     I've documented most of it in an issue.  For example, we need to make it
     easy to extend the lifeline (communication line) and move a group of
     messages up or down so that message can be inserted or deleted within the
     sequence.
med
     
1.36 margin:  Model elements butt up against the side of the diagram instead
     of having some white space around them.
done

1.37 z-order: when two elements overlap and the user clicks the bottom one, the 
     selection line is drawn around the entire bottom element, but the bottom
     element is not raised to the top of the z-order.  Thus, the selection line
     is drawn through the top-most element.  This looks wierd.  Suggest the 
     selected element be moved to the top of the z-order on selection.
low/no

1.38 Support in place editing for description tooltips.  It would be nice to
     allow the user to hit F2 giving current focus to the tooltip, which then
     could be scrolled and edited.
med

1.39 The ability to delete an orphaned graphic seems to have been lost with the
     introduction of the new graphics.  The ability to delete an orphaned 
     graphic was introduced with the following issue: 
     http://tucson.wv.mentorg.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2585
     Investigate and restore this functionality.
high

1.40 Make the behavior of the mouse wheel "zoom" consistent. Currently, when 
     the canvas is selected the wheel moves the cavas vertically and after a 
     zoom selection, the wheel moves though the zoom levels allow zoom-in and 
     out on the canvas.  The zoom is very nice IMO, but the inconsistent 
     behavior will be considered a bug.
	[8:35:42 AM | Edited 8:36:48 AM] Bob: Did you know that with the new 
	graphics the mouse wheel zooms in and out moving between our defined zoom 
	levels ?   That is very nice!
	[8:36:58 AM | Edited 8:37:26 AM] Campbell McCausland: Just tried it. Yes it 
	works, but not the first time you open (actually, focus) the diagram.
	[8:37:39 AM | Edited 8:37:58 AM] Bob: Well, you have to have just select 
	the zoom level.  If you select the canvas then the action is different.
	[8:37:43 AM] Campbell McCausland: You have to select a new zoom level, then 
	it works.
	[8:38:51 AM] Bob: The is probably a bug.  The action should be consistent, 
	I will add it to the list.
	[8:38:57 AM] Campbell McCausland: Ah yes, you're actually scrolling the 
	selector.
	[8:39:12 AM] Bob: Oh, yeah...
	[8:39:29 AM] Bob: OK, I guess it is not a bug.
	[8:39:37 AM] Campbell McCausland: Another thing is that it also scrolls 
	into Page etc. which means the diagram goes huge and then jumps back.
	[8:40:10 AM] Campbell McCausland: So its probably not a 'feature' we want 
	to put front and center.
	[8:40:36 AM] Campbell McCausland: I recall Neil Ernshaw asking for wheel 
	operation to do that.
	[8:41:46 AM] Campbell McCausland: If the canvas is selected the wheel 
	scrolls vertically
	[8:42:12 AM] Bob: That is the current tool behavior too.
	[8:42:24 AM] Campbell McCausland: My own opinion on Ernshaws request is 
	that you want to scroll as often (or perhaps more often) than zooming
	[8:43:05 AM] Campbell McCausland: However, what would be nice is modifier 
	keys; hold down ctrl or alt to get different wheel behavior.
	[8:43:39 AM] Campbell McCausland: so no modifier scrolls vertically, 
	ctrl zooms and alt scrolls horizontally.      
high

1.41 Show labels (port names) to ports on the component diagram.  It would be
     great if these could be turned on/off (project globally).
high

1.42 Removed "disjoint complete" from generalization/specialization.
done

1.43 In Domain Package diagram, create a Function Package, then create  another 
nested Function package inside the previous one by right click on the parent 
Function Package either from the canvas or from the ME. The child Function 
Package will be displayed at the Domain Package next to its parent Function 
Package beside being inside it.
The canvas and ME are inconsistent. Another way to reproduce it, double click on 
any function package and without selecting any item, do right click on empty 
canvas and create a new Function Package. Both Function Packages will be visible 
at the parent Function package level from the canvas
This can be reproduced using External Entity Package.
