BridgePoint Project Implementation Note
Constants


1. Abstract
-----------
Constants support is coming to BridgePoint.  The work is broken into two phases
and the first phase is being put into HEAD in several steps.  This INT covers
the second development step promotion.

4. Background
-------------
See [2] and [3].

5. Design
---------
5.1  During the original development cycle for phase 1, we decided to promote
     the constants work in several steps to bring the integration earlier into
     the release cycle.  This was done with the understanding that some issues
     would exist in the promoted work that must be corrected later.

5.2  This second development step focused on two issues:
  5.2.1  There were relationships in the Constants Subsystem to remove.
    5.2.1.1  Remove the S_DOM---R1507---CNST_CSP relationship.  Made fallout
             changes to dispose functions, traversals, etc.
    5.2.1.2  Remove the S_CDT---R1501---CNST_LSC relationship.  Made fallout
             changes to dispose functions, traversals, etc.
  5.2.2  The Cut/Copy/Paste of a Constant Specification was sending numerous
         errors to the log.
    5.2.2.1  Change traversals to find the system differently.

5.3  Ongoing work.  There will be another development step after this promotion.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Some JUnit tests were run and passed.

8. Code Changes
---------------
Changes are in branch R2_1_3-SKB-dts0100530239-02
