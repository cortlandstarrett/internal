Verifier        FAIL       1 duplicated console message (seen before) 1 IO access to CVS issue, 1
                           signal not executed. 1 result file not found (due to upper lower case
                           sensitivity?). 1 breakpoint not set.
Core System L   Pass
Core II         Pass       With co-ordinates omitted. Added nested R&D loop in the chooseItemInDialog
                           utility method.

Core-RTO        FAIL       2 Referring element was not left as default rto. Also seeing lots of NPE's
                           in ImportedReference_c.Canrefertointerfacereference which do not get
                           detected by the tests. These could be causing the above flagged errors.
                           Also, getting RSI dismissing dialogs about resetting types which do not
                           seem to be anticipated by the test. Again, this is not causing detected
                           failures if the dialog is manually dismissed.
ParseAll        Pass
