HOWTO Update to a New Version of Mentor Licensing (PCLS/MGLS)
-------------------------------------------------------------
_- Log into the build server
_- Open Firefox
_- Go on DevNet to the Reusable Assets > Licensing section
_- Locate the release you want to update to
_- Create a desktop folder license, with subdirs win and linux
_- Download the Windows and Unix mgc.pkginfo files to the appropriate desktop
    dirs just created
_- Download the Windows PCLS and RHEL4 MGLS license runtime files to the 
    appropriate desktop dir
_- Extract the downloaded runtime files for each OS
_- Copy the **Windows** version of mgc.pkginfo to 
    C:\BridgePoint_for_Linux_e3.7\BridgePointDeliverables\extras\wine_addons
      NOTE: Generator is currently tied the an old version of MGLS.dll, one that
      was built with VC6 as generator is.  It cannot be upgraded to a newer
      MGLS.dll without updating the generator build, which we've found to be 
      very difficult and have given up on several times.
_- Start BridgePoint, open workspace C:\workspaces\mgls_update
_- Check out the HEAD versions of the plugins:
    com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.linux.x86
    com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.win32.x86
_- Update the linux mgls files
  _- Open <desktop>/license/linux/exports<version>-ixf\mgc_home\pkgs\mgls.ixf in
      Windows explorer
  _- Copy the bin/, etc/, and lib/ folders
  _- Paste the folders into eclipse to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.linux.x86\os\linux\x86\, overwrite the existing
      files
  _- Copy the **Linux** version of mgc.pkginfo to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.linux.x86\os\linux\x86\lib, overwrite the 
      existing file
_- Update the Windows pcls files
  _- Open <desktop>/license/win/mgls.ixn/lib in Windows explorer
  _- Copy the MGCLD.EXE and MGLS.DLL files
  _- Paste the file into eclipse to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.win32.x86\os\win32\x86\lib\, overwrite the 
      existing file
  _- Copy the **Windows** version of mgc.pkginfo to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.win32.x86\os\win32\x86\lib, overwrite the 
      existing file
_- Commit the files to HEAD
_- Navigate to \\wv\dfs\seamless_archives\templates
  _- Verify there exists a license documentation dir (e.g. mgc_lic_v2011_1) for
     the version of licensing you're upgrading to.  If one does not exist,
     create it and populate it with the appropriate files (found on SupportNet
     in the Licensing product docs)
_- Edit <BP CVS>/Documentation/internal/process/releases/scripts/mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh
   to point at the new license doc dir in the MGLS_DOC_DIR variable
_- Edit <BP CVS>/Documentation/internal/process/releases/scripts/create_xml_BridgePoint
   to use the new version numbers in the xml files created for the new license docs
_- Upload the updated scripts to \\wv\dfs\seamless_archives\bin
_- Update the Java Licensing Component (JLC)
  -- NOTE: the JLC can be downloaded here: http://devnet.mentorg.com/assets/licensing/lsjava/windows_release.html
     We only use the Windows version.
  _- Put a new JLC jar in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core
  _- Search the bp.core plugin for "jlc"
  _- Update the references to the new jar file
