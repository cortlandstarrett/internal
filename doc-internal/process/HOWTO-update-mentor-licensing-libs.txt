HOWTO Update to a New Version of Mentor Licensing (PCLS/MGLS)
-------------------------------------------------------------
_- Log into the server svr-azt-eng-03
_- Create a desktop folder named "license", with subdirs "win" and "linux"
_- Open Firefox

_- Go to http://mentorweb.wv.mentorg.com/licenseDefinitions/build/build!currentFile
_- Download the Windows and Unix mgc.pkginfo files to the appropriate desktop
    dirs just created
    
_- Go on DevNet to the Reusable Assets > Licensing section : http://devnet.mentorg.com/assets/licensing/
_- Download the Windows PCLS (32-bit/ixn) and RHEL (32-bit/ixl) MGLS license 
    runtime files to the appropriate desktop folder
_- Extract the downloaded runtime files for each OS

_- Open BridgePoint on the workspace c:/workspaces/build_artifacts
_- Copy the **Windows** version of mgc.pkginfo to the eclipse project location: 
    BridgePoint_for_Linux_e3.7\BridgePointDeliverables\extras\wine_addons
      NOTE: Generator is currently tied the an old version of MGLS.dll, one that
      was built with VC6 as generator is.  It cannot be upgraded to a newer
      MGLS.dll without updating the generator build, which we've found to be 
      very difficult and have given up on several times.
_- Commit the updated file
_- Close BridgePoint
   
NOTE:  The following steps involve committing files to git repositories, which is
  hard to do on our shared server.  It is recommended that the following steps be
  performed on a user's development machine.
     
_- Open BridgePoint on the development workspace
_- Switch to Git Repository Exploring perspective and Pull to get the latest master data
_- Switch to the Java perspective
_- Update the linux mgls files
  _- Open <desktop>/license/linux/exports<version>-ixl\mgc_home\pkgs\mgls.ixl in
      Windows explorer
  _- Copy the bin/, etc/, and lib/ folders
  _- Paste the folders into the project inside BridgePoint at: 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.linux.x86\os\linux\x86\, overwrite the existing
      files
  _- Copy the **Linux** version of mgc.pkginfo to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.linux.x86\os\linux\x86\lib, overwrite the 
      existing file
_- Update the Windows pcls files
  _- Open <desktop>/license/win/mgls.ixn/lib in Windows explorer
  _- Copy the MGCLD.EXE and MGLS.DLL files
  _- Paste the files into the project inside BridgePoint at: 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.win32.x86\os\win32\x86\lib\, overwrite the 
      existing file
  _- Copy the **Windows** version of mgc.pkginfo to 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core.win32.x86\os\win32\x86\lib, overwrite the 
      existing file
_- Commit the files to master

_- Update the Java Licensing Component (JLC)
  -- NOTE: the JLC can be downloaded here: http://devnet.mentorg.com/assets/licensing/
     We only use the 32-bit Windows and Unix versions.
  _- Put a new JLC jar in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core
    - TODO - This needs more detail
    - Download the 32-bit Windows runtime version zipfile
    - Using the existing bp.core/jlc_<ver>.jar as a guide, create a new jar with
      the class files from the 32-bit Windows runtime that was just downloaded.
  _- Search the bp.core plugin for "jlc"
  _- Update the references to the new jar file
_- Commit the files to master

_- Navigate to \\wv\dfs\seamless_archives\templates
  _- Verify there exists a license documentation dir (e.g. mgc_lic_v2011_1) for
     the version of licensing you're upgrading to.  If one does not exist,
     create it and populate it with the appropriate files (found on SupportNet
     in the Licensing product docs)
_- Edit <BP CVS>/Documentation/internal/process/releases/scripts/mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh
   to point at the new license doc dir in the MGLS_DOC_DIR variable
_- Edit <BP CVS>/Documentation/internal/process/releases/scripts/create_xml_BridgePoint
   to use the new version numbers in the xml files created for the new license docs
_- Upload the updated scripts to \\wv\dfs\seamless_archives\bin
