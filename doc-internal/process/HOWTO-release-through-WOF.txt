Introduction
------------
There are various people involved in the release process.  Here are some names
to be aware of:
    o Gail Flanagan (Team lead - WoF)
    o Joanne StJohn (BridgePoint Release Analyst - WoF)

WOF has created a document [5] that provides important information for the
release captain and developers. The Release Captain's Checklist [6] captures
important milestones along the road of making a release.

NOTE: Mentor enforces a blackout period.  There are no releases in the last two
weeks of a quarter without high-level approvals (Serge, Todd Christensen, 
Rick Trebing)

Steps
-----
1  Make sure all Open Source Software to be released with the product has the 
   proper approvals from Mentor Legal Department.
1.1  If necessary, run the license detective [1] and submit new OSS requests 
     for approval [2].
     
2  Decide on the configuration of the release (# of CDs, names, etc, EAD, MSI 
   version, MGLS version)
            
3  Start Documentation
3.1  Retrieve the Release Captain's checklist template [6].  Create a new
     release number dir under [9]. Copy the release captain checklist to this
     dir and start filling it out.  Continue to follow the steps to during the
     release process. 

4  Register the release
4.1  Navigate to [4]
4.2  Search for the prior product release using the listbox at the bottom of 
     the page.
4.3  Locate the previous release, click on the release number.  This will take
     you back to [4], with the prior release number filled in.
4.4  Click the "Retrieve Committed For New Registration" button.
4.5  Fill out the form and submit it.
4.6  The release will be registered.
        
5  Validate artwork
5.1  We validate artwork, match part numbers, versions, copyrights, platform 
     info, etc.
5.2  Wait for artwork to be created by Ireland.  Validate it once received.
     Artwork *must* be validated at least 7 days before manufacturing start.
        
6  Develop product, docs, generate internal releases, installer, QA & test
6.1  Update the metamodel model in bp.welcome.  Follow the steps in 
     bp.welcome/README.txt
6.2  Decide if we will move to a newer version of MGLS/PCLS.  To update to a new
     version see [12]
 
7  Prepare release candidate
7.1  Docs Freeze & Feature Freeze; followed by Code Freeze (make sure CC & CQ 
     are updated)
7.1.1  Once the Release Notes and What's New are done, alert the Product Marketing
       Manager that they need to create a Value Sheet for the release.  Save
       the Value sheet to \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>
7.2  Create a release branch (e.g. "v4.1.0") in the git xtuml/internal, 
     xtuml/mc & xtuml/generator repositories.  Push the new branch upstream.
7.3  Create a release branch for the SVN artifacts repository for the release.
       - Remote desktop to svr-azt-eng-03
       - Start BridgePoint, open C:\workspaces\build_artifacts
       - Switch to SVN Repository Exploring Perspective
       - Expand the repository, then right click on "branches" and select 
           "New > Folder".  Add a new branch named the same as the branch used in 
           github (e.g. "v4.1.0")
       - Expand "trunk", select all the folders under trunk.  Right-click and 
           select Copy.  Then Paste the items under the new version branch.
7.4  Create release build.
7.5  Notify the BridgePoint customer support representative that a release
     candidate is ready for testing.
   
8  Follow instructions in [10]       

#
# 9 Release doc prep
#
# All Mentor Graphics releases that ship on CD/DVD media must have a 
# Installation Instructions document in PDF format in the release_documents 
# directory, at the top level of Disk 1. For web-based releases, this PDF 
# document must also be available for viewing from that release's download page 
# on SupportNet. This document is not shipped as hardcopy.
#
9.1 Download the template at [8] or use the one from the prior release as a 
      base. The prior release documentation can be found under [9].
9.2 Create a folder for the new release under [9]
9.3 Update the install doc to account for the new version, release date, headers,
      footers, TOC, and any changes to the document content
9.4 Save it to BridgePoint_<version>_Install.doc
9.5 Use MS Word's Save As... feature to save the file in PDF format
9.6 Perform the same steps to update the Release Highlights document for this
      release.
9.7 Copy the Install PDF file to the following locations:
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\web\<release #>\release_docs
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\web
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\cd_1\release_documents
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\cd_2\release_documents
9.8 Copy the Release Highlights PDF file to the following locations:
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\web\<release #>\release_docs 
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\cd_1\release_documents
      \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\cd_2\release_documents
9.9 Commit the new files under [9] to revision control

#
# 10 Create xml files for SupportNet
#
# We have a tool that generates them (create_xml_BridgePoint). The tool knows  
#   about SupportNet hierarchy. Tool is run by mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh 
#   script inside step 8.
# Have to do hand edits to fix title, version, and paths as necessary. Check
# each file.
#   NOTE: The release highlights and install doc paths should point into
#         release_docs/ not docs/pdfdocs/
#
10.1 Check xml files in \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<ver>\web\<rel#>\docs\xml for correctness

#
# 11 Import Documentation to SupportNet
# Documentation import should occur prior to creating the CD image.  For
# important information about this step see [7]. You must have JavaScript 
# enabled and allow popups coming from mentor.com.
#
11.1 Navigate to [7] and follow Step 2 to import the docs to SupportNet. 
     Subactions 1 & 2 are basically:
    o On a Wilsonville UNIX machine: 
      $ cd /wv/svd_for_cd/BridgePoint_<version>/web
      $ zip -r <SKU> <SKU>
      $ cp <SKU>.zip /wv/techpubs/docimportdrop/    (NOTE: this step requires proper permissions.  See [7].)
11.2 Still on [7], follow Step 3 to verify the imported docs on the authoring server

#
# 12 Upload the files for Manufacturing
#   NOTE: Previous steps can be performed multiple times.  The following steps
#         should only be run ONCE, as they trigger  activities in the 
#         manufacturing process.
#
#   Steps performed by this script:
#   - Create tgz image of CDs
#   - FTP image and its check sum file to Manufacturing
#   - FTP web ReadMe and any other files required for Intraware Site and their 
#     check sum files to Manufacturing
#   - Create ESDM request e-mail
#
12.1  Log in to your Wilsonville UNIX terminal again
12.2  Run the following commands:
  $ cd /wv/seamless_archives/bin
  $ ./mk_cd_image
    - Enter e-mail
    - Enter Business Unit (e.g. SLE)
    - Enter Release Number (e.g. 201310001)
    - Enter Release Name   (e.g. BridgePoint_4.1.0)
    - Enter release software location  (e.g. BridgePoint_4.1.0)
    - Enter number of CDs (e.g. 2)
    - Answer patch question (e.g. 201305035)
    - Enter ESDM Filenames and Descriptions for the EXE, IXL, and Install doc.
        Enter no data to exit the loop.  For example:
            ESDM FILENAME1: BridgePoint_4.1.0_Install.pdf
            ESDM FILEDESCRIPTION1: BridgePoint 4.1.0 Installation Instructions
            ESDM FILENAME2: BridgePoint_v4.1.0.ixl
            ESDM FILEDESCRIPTION2: BridgePoint 4.1.0 Linux Installer
            ESDM FILENAME3: BridgePoint_v4.1.0.exe
            ESDM FILEDESCRIPTION3: BridgePoint 4.1.0 Windows Installer
            ESDM FILENAME4: <enter>
            ESDM FILEDESCRIPTION4: <enter>
    - Enter CD part number (e.g.  257809)
      o Navigate to [4], enter the SKU, click View Media Content
      o Find the CD part number of the appropriate OS for the given files
    - Enter the CD title (e.g. BridgePoint 4.1.0, Linux)
        NOTE: The CD image is created here, this can take a few minutes.
    - Repeat for the other CD
        NOTE: The FTP step can take some time.
    - An e-mail will be sent to you with the ESDM data. Keep this e-mail handy.

#
# 13 Validate CDs (Optional)
#   
13.1  FTP files from ftp://svr-ies-ftp-01.ies.mentorg.com/pub/wof/<release#>
13.2  Burn and test CD images

#
# 14 Submit ESDM request to Release Team and Manufacturing
# 
14.1  Forward the CD/ESDM release e-mail to rdm_releases@mentor.com and wofmdsesdm@mentor.com
  o If you must redo the CD after emailing ESDM e-mail to RDM...
    1) Remove /wv/svd_for_cd/BridgePoint_<ver>/*.tgz
    2) Rename /wv/svd_for_cd/BridgePoint_<ver>/<CD PN> to cd_1 and cd_2 
       appropriately
    3) Repeat starting at step 8
    4) Send ESDM e-mail again with "Rework" added to the subject and in the 
       comments say why the rework is needed.
14.2  Wait for e-mail indicating manufacturing has finished processing the request.
14.3  Validate downloads from SupportNet Authoring Site [11]
  - It is quickest to remote into a machine in Wilsonville, launch a browser and
    pull down the Linux and Windows Installers.  Then do md5sum comparisons
    with the original files from tucson.
  - You can also install on remote machines and smoke test
14.4  Create MRC
  o The MRC was automatically created by an earlier script and stored at
    \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<release #>\BridgePoint_<release #>_mrc.html
  o Open the file with MS Word.  Go through the file and check that all the 
    fields are filled out properly and the proper checkboxes are checked. Verify
    that the product table appears at the end of the doc.  If it does not, open 
    this file in a text editor and move the product table at the end of the
    document up inside the body and html tags. Close the file.
  o Use MS Word's "Save As" to save the file in PDF form
14.5  E-mail MRC and Release Highlights to the people marked in the release registration
  as the Product Marketing and Customer Support Managers for approval
  o Save approval e-mails to PDF and copy them to 
    \\wv\dfs\svd_for_cd\BridgePoint_<release #>
14.6  E-mail MRC, Release Highlights, Value sheet (or commitment to create it) 
  and Approvals to Release Team and WOF (rdm_releases@mentor.com and wofmdsesdm@mentor.com)
14.7  Wait for Release Team to enable MGC SupportNet
14.8  Verify docs & s/w on the MGC supportnet once MS date arrives

15  Package, save, and ship the C source arcs (example steps below)
  # In whatever manner you prefer, navigate to the xtuml/mc repository and pull
  # the latest data from github.  Then switch to (checkout) the version tag for
  # this release.
  $ mkdir /tmp/arc
  $ cd <git>/xtuml/mc/arc
  $ cp * /tmp/arc
  $ cd c
  $ cp * /tmp/arc
  $ cd /tmp
  $ zip -r arc arc
  $ mv arc.zip BridgePoint_<ver>_C_templates.zip   (e.g. BridgePoint_4.1.0_C_templates.zip)
  o Then copy the zip to \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\engineering_releases\v<ver>_MC3020\  (e.g. v4.1.0_MC3020\)
  o E-mail the zipfile to Robert Rice, Dean McArthur, John Wolfe, John Vargas,
    and Cort Starrett for distribution to source MC customers
    
Congratulations!  You have finished the release.
