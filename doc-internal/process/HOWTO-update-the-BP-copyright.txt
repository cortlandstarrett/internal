Background
----------
With each new year it is necessary to update to copyright messages in the
BridgePoint source repository.  There is a utility for this purpose.  

Intended Audience
-----------------
This document is intended for the BridgePoint development team.

Steps
-----
_- You must have perl installed on your machine
_- Launch Eclipse
_- For each repository to update: xtuml/internal, xtuml/mc, etc
_- Update your development workspace with the latest version master
_- Create a branch
_- Verify your cloned xtuml/internal repository contains the "utilities" project
_R The utility that is used to update copyright messages is
   <xtuml/internal>/utilities/update-copyright/update-copyright.pl
_R Note: This utility does have a usage screen.  To see it use the --help 
         option.
_- Open a shell
_- cd <git repository home>/xtuml/internal/src
_- ../utilities/update-copyright/update-copyright.pl --recursive --year YYYY ./
_R A message will be displayed when the procedure is complete and it will tell 
   you that a file named update-copyright-results.txt has been created.  This
   contains a report of the changes.
_- Examine the report and modify it (and the modified files) to remove:
    _- Items that have 3rd party copyrights. 
   _- Anything else you see in the report that you will not be checking-in
_- Search workspace for "opyright*<old year>"
  _- Fix any matches to the new year.  Ignore matches under the utilities project.
     Only update files doc-internal/process that make sense.
_- Move the update-copyright-results.txt to the issue # folder under doc-internal/notes
_- Commit the modified files to the repository by following normal check-in 
   procedures.
