# xtUML Project Checklist
### Introducing new modules


Checklist
---------
```
_- Make sure there is plug-in entry in feature.xml under com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg-feature

_- generate.xml has following targets:
   For Nightly builds to work:
   . nb_all   - This is default target called by nightly build script, this 
                should depend on any targets that are necessary to build given 
                plugin outside eclipse.
   . compile  - Since these targets are called outside eclipse through a shell 
                script, it should be included to compile java classes, which 
                otherwise are compiled by 'Java Builder' added under 'External 
                Tools Builders' as default when new plugin project is created.
  
   General
   . all        - Depends on all the targets of the file (i.e. executes all). 
                  That is why it is set to the default target in the ant 
                  project.
   . clean_all  - This deletes every file being generated by the "all".  It 
                  should also use other targets (each specialized to delete 
                  files generated by a specific target) to execute this target.
   . delete     - Deletes the runtime generated files such as ".gen", 
                  "____file.txt", etc.

_- Verify that a project that contains automated unit tests for this plugin
   has been added to the unit_test_modules list in 
   utilities/build/create_release_functions.sh
   
_- <export name="*" /> element has been added to <runtime> in plugin.xml.
  NOTE: This is not required for plugins shipped as a single jar file
```
