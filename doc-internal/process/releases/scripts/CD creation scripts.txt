BridgePoint Technical Note
Release CD Creation

Abstract
--------
This note describes how to create the BridgePoint CD and Web data for a release
of the product.  The script is run as part of the release process [1].  The 
mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh and mk_cd_image scripts create the release 
repository at /wv/svd_for_cd/BridgePoint_<version>.

Secondary Files
---------------
create_xml_BridgePoint
    Is usually run by the mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh script.  If not it
    needs to be run by hand to create the xml files after the 
    mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh script is run.

Steps
-----
Log in to tucson.wv.mentorg.com

#
# 1) Make sure account is prepped
#   You must have a .netrc file set up in your /user/$USER dir (and /home/$USER
#   if that dir exists).  If not, create it and add this line:
#     default login ftp password <your e-mail>@mentor.com
#
cd /user/$USER
ls .netrc

#
# 2) Stage the installers
#
cd /user/$USER
mkdir -p downloads/BridgePoint/installers
cd downloads/BridgePoint/installers
cp /arch1/products/tiger/releases/<release tag>/*.ixl .
cp /arch1/products/tiger/releases/<release tag>/*.exe .
mv BridgePoint_<release tag>_<datestamp>.ixl BridgePoint_<release num>.ixl
mv BridgePoint_<release tag>_<datestamp>.exe BridgePoint_<release num>.exe

#
# 3) Prep the MRC
#   NOTE: If you are only updating the application executables and not the
#         documentation you may skip to step 6 now.
#
Open doc-internal/process/releases/scripts/BridgePoint_head_mrc_template.html
  - Update the effective date in the file to be the MS date
  - Update the OSS additions and subtractions
  - Read through the document making any other required changes
  - Save the file as "Web Page, Filtered"
  - Check in the file to git and push to github
Open \\wv\dfs\seamless_archives\templates
Copy the updated file from your local machine into the network directory

#
# 4) VNC to cveixl4qa2
#
# NOTE: Skip this step if you have a Linux VM you can log into on the WV network
#
# The BP documentation needs to be unpacked and made available for the build
# scripts.  This is done by VNC-ing into a Linux host in WV and running the 
# Linux installer.  The aforementioned server is managed by Garry Bales. 
#
telnet to cveixl4qa2
run "vncserver" from the command prompt
note the display session information (e.g.  cveixl4qa2:3)
run "vncpasswd" if required (i.e. if you've never VNC'd here before)
use a VNC viewer application (like TightVNC) to VNC to the noted machine
  display
Log in with the VNC password you set
If the screensaver kicks in, login with your MG UNIX user/pass

#
# 5) Run the Linux installer to make documentation tree available
#
Log into your linux VM (or open a terminal on the VNC desktop from step 4)
cd /wv/seamlessweb/usr3/downloads/BridgePoint
rm -rf MentorGraphics/
cd /user/$USER/downloads/BridgePoint/installers
./BridgePoint*.ixl
#  During the target selection, replace /home/<user> with 
#  /wv/seamlessweb/usr3/downloads/BridgePoint

#
# 6) Get the release registration number
#   
Navigate to: http://mentorweb.wv.mentorg.com/ReleaseRegistration/
In the Release Name dropdown list, select "BridgePoint", click Search
Note the release number/SKU (e.g. 201002064) for the release your packaging
  now. Should be the top item in the list.

#
# 7) Run the scripts to create the release cd and web structure
#   NOTE: if the file is there but when you try to run it you get a "command
#   not found" error, it means you need to run dos2unix on the script to convert
#   it to unix format.
#
#   NOTE: if there has been new documentation added under bp.doc for this
#   release, you must update the mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh and
#   create_xml_BridgePoint scripts and put them into place before running it.
#
go back to the tucson.wv shell
cd /wv/seamless_archives/bin
./mk_cds_rdme_mrc_BridgePoint.ksh
    - Enter e-mail
    - Enter version (e.g 3.1.2)
    - Enter release location to use (likely use default given)
        NOTE: If you are just updating the executables and not documentation, 
              answer "N" to the query about deleting the existing directory.
    - Enter Release Number (e.g. 201002064)
    - Enter a reason (e.g. Bug fixes, enhancements, new features)
    - The script will search for the linux installer. Enter type of release.
    - The script will search for the Windows installer. Enter type of release.
    - If you are just updating executables, you will be prompted about skipping
      the re-creation of documentation.  Answer as you wish. (y or n)
    - Depending on your previous answer, the script will create the web and CD 
      trees at <release location>/ (as you specified in substep 3 above)
    - Proceed back to [1 ยง9]
