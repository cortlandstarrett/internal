    Provide a licensing solution for the 2009 ET-robocon educational challenge
    Note: This was the issue where we introduced a way to provide a demo 
    version of BP.  The development notes describe the options we examined
    and why we selected the method we did.

How to create a BP demo
-----------------------
-- Determine the demo period.  You will need to know the start date and the end
   date.
   20131212-20140331
   
_- Create an issue in ClearQuest to track the request for a new demo.   
   For an example see dts0100685202.
         cq issue: <TODO>
         
_- Create an issue in the git/internal repository to serve as a "twin" for
   the CQ issue.
         git: <TODO>

-- Build the source with the demo license check enabled   
	_- Open a standard BridgePoint development workspace.
	
	_- Get the appropriate version of the source for the demo.  Use a 
	   release tag to check out the appropriate version if needed.
	 
	_- Create a new branch for the demo version.  NOTE!!  These changes will 
	   NOT be promoted to master.	  
		_- Create a branch (example v4.1.4Demo) for the changes.
		   You will need to branch the git/internal and git/generator
		   repositories. 
	             
	_- Enable the demo license check in bp.core	
		_- Uncomment the java code in 
		   bp/core/util/BridgePointLicenseManager.java::isDemoLicensed()
		   that turns on the demo license
		_- Check in the change to the branch
	
	_- Allow demo post-install cleanup
	    _- Add the script code in Installer_MIP_MIMIC/post_install_script.bat
	       and post_install_script.sh that removes unneeded MCs (leaving mc.none) from demo 
	       installations.  Compare these files with a previous demo branch (e.g. v4.1.8Demo) to 
	       see the necessary changes.
	       
	_- Update the BridgePoint version number as described in [2]
	
	_- Build the workspace

	_R The workspace builds successfully
         
-- Create a new demo key file
	_- Open the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project in the Java perspective   
	_- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and build it 
	  (Project > Build Project)
	_R BridgePointDemoKeyCreator builds with no errors
	_- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and run it 
	   (right click > Run As... > Java Application)
	_- Enter the demo start date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	_- Enter the demo end date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	_R The demo file, BridgePointDemo.txt, is create in the C:/ folder
	_- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt created in the previous step to:
	   <workspace>/BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate>
	   where startdate is the YYYYMMDD for the demo start and enddate is 
	   YYYYMMDD for the end of the  demo.
	_- Check in the demo file to the branch

-- Modify gen_erate.exe to allow the binary model compiler to run during the 
   demo period.	
	_- Modify <git>generator//gen_erate/bp_source/win32/7.1B/main/src/gen_erate/main_gen_erate.cc
	   and put in the hard-coded date-check.  To see what this code looks like 
	   compare branch v4.1.4Demo of main_gen_erate.cc with master.
	   Note that this change simply wraps the binary 3020 license in a 
	   try/catch block that allows the binary license to work for the specified 
	   (hardcoded) demo period.
	_- Note!!  Make sure you change the 2 hard-coded dates in the above code to
	   reflect the correct demo start and end dates.
	_- Update the version number in this same file
	_- Check in the change to the branch
	_- Build a new gen_erate.exe [3] on svr-azt-eng-03
	
-- Create a branch in svn [5] to hold all the "extra files" needed for the 
   BridgePoint build
    _- Log in to svr-azt-eng-03
    _- Open BridgePoint on c:/workspaces/build_artifacts
    _- Open the SVN Repository Exploring perspective
    _- Expand http://wv-svn-01.wv.mentorg.com/svn/sle/xtuml, log in with 
       your MGC user/pass.  Do not save credentials.
    _- Create a branch in svn [5] with the same name used for the git branch
       (for example: v4.1.4Demo), by right-clicking on "branches" and selecting 
       New > Folder.
    _- From the svn repositories view, copy the following projects from trunk 
       and paste them into the new branch:
       apache-ant
       bp_build_tools
       BridgePoint_e<X.X>
       BridgePoint_for_Linux_e<X.X>
       eclipse
       extra_files_for_build
       mgls
       MIMIC
    _R The new branch is now created with all the files needed for the build 
       server.
   	
-- Check in gen_erate.exe to the svn branch created above that the build server 
   will use to build the product.	
    _- Check out the extra_files_for_build project from the svn branch 
    _- Copy the new gen_erate.exe into extra_files_for_build/gen_erate.exe and
       check this into the branch.
    	          
-- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt file into place so it can be include in the 
   build of the installer.
   
   _- Transfer the BridgePointDemo.txt from earlier to svr-azt-eng-03
   
   -- First we do the process for the windows version of the tool
    _- Still using the c:/workspaces/build_artifacts workspace, check out 
       BridgePoint_e<X.Y>/BridgePointDeliverables/license from the svn branch for the demo.
       Note: We only check out this folder because the BridgePoint_e<X.Y> 
             project is HUGE and we don't need the whole thing.
    _- Copy <git internal>BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> to 
       the "license" folder that was just checked out.
    _- Rename BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> to
	   BridgePointDemo.txt
	_- Check BridgePointDemo.txt into the branch	   
	_- Delete the "license" project from your workspace

    -- Now repeat the above steps for Linux		
    _- Repeat the steps above, but instead of BridgePoint_e<X.Y>, use 
       BridgePoint_for_Linux_e<X.Y>
	   
_- Launch the branch build on the build server [6].
_R Build is successful

-- Test the installers
   _- Install the demo on Windows
   _- If any MGLS* or LM* environment variable exit in the test environment
      comment them out (simply rename them by adding "noForDemo" to their name). 
   _- Install BridgePoint 
   _- Launch the tool
   _R No license errors
   _- Use the Getting started demo to create MicrowaveOven
   _- Build MicrowaveOven with MC3020
   _R No errors
   _- Launch verifier and run MicrowaveOven
   _R No Errors
   _- Change the system date to 1 day after expiration
   _R License errors appear
   _- Restore the system date and any environment variable that were 
      commented-out in the first step.
   _- FYI (for internal testing), note that after hitting a license error with 
      the demo version the tool will continue to fail (with license errors) 
      until a new, clean, valid,copy of BridgePointDemo.txt is put into the 
      license folder.
   // Linux demo still not working
   //_- Install the demo on linux.  
   //   Note: You must install to: /usr/local/MentorGraphics
   //   To do this create the folder /usr/local/MentorGrpahics and change 
   //   ownership of that folder to user that will perform the installation.
   //_- Repeat the test steps that were performed for Windows
   
-- Archive the installer
  _- Open the location \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\engineering releases
  _- Create a subdir with the release number and purpose
  _- Copy the Windows installer into this directory
  _- Copy the Linux installer into this directory
