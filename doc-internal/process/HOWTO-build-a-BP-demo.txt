    Provide a licensing solution for the 2009 ET-robocon educational challenge
    Note: This was the issue where we introduced a way to provide a demo 
    version of BP.  The development notes describe the options we examined
    and why we selected the method we did.

    These are the large binary files like the eclipse installation, and other 
    binaries.

How to create a BP demo
-----------------------
-- Determine the demo period.  You will need to know the start date and the end
   date.
   20131212-20140331
   
_- Create a issue in ClearQuest to track the request for a new demo.   
   For an example see dts0100685202.
         cq issue: <TODO>
         
_- Create a issue in the git/internal repository to serve as a "twin" for
   the CQ issue.
         git: <TODO>

-- Build the source with the demo license check enabled   
	_- Open a standard BridgePoint development workspace based on the head 
	   branch.
	
	_- Get the appropriate version of the source for the demo.  Use a 
	   release tag to check out the appropriate version if needed.
	 
	_- Create a new branch for the demo version.  NOTE!!  These changes will 
	   NOT be promoted to head.	  
		_- Create a branch (example v4.1.4Demo) for the changes
		   You will need to branch the git/internal and git/generator
		   repositories 
	             
	_- Enable the demo license check in bp.core	
		_- "Uncomment" the java code in 
		   bp/core/util/BridgePointLicenseManager.java::isDemoLicensed()
		   that turns on the demo license
		_- Check in the change to the branch
	
	_- Allow demo post-install cleanup
	    _- Uncomment the script code in Installer_MIP_MIMIC/post_install_script.bat
	       and post_install_script.sh that removes unneeded MCs from demo 
	       installations.
	       
	_- Update the BridgePoint version number as described in [2]
	
	_- Build the workspace

	_R The workspace builds successfully
         
-- Create a new demo key file
	_- Open the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project in the Java perspective   
	_- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and build it 
	  (Project > Build Project)
	_R BridgePointDemoKeyCreator builds with no errors
	_- Select the BridgePointDemoKeyCreator project and run it 
	   (right click > Run As... > Java Application)
	_- Enter the demo start date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	_- Enter the demo end date in YYYYMMDD format and select OK
	_R The demo file, BridgePointDemo.txt, is create in the C:/ folder
	_- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt created in the previous step to:
	   <workspace>/BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate>
	   where startdate is the YYYYMMDD for the demo start and enddate is 
	   YYYYMMDD for the end of the  demo.
	_- Check in the demo file to the branch

-- Modify gen_erate.exe to allow the binary model compiler to run during the 
   demo period.	
	_- Modify <git>generator//gen_erate/bp_source/win32/7.1B/main/src/gen_erate/main_gen_erate.cc
	   and put in the hard-coded date-check.  To see what this code looks like 
	   compare branch v4.1.4Demo of main_gen_erate.cc with master.
	   Note that this change simply wraps the binary 3020 license in a 
	   try/catch block that allows the binary license to work for the specified 
	   (hardcoded) demo period.
	_- Note!!  Make sure you change the 2 hard-coded dates in the above code to
	   reflect the correct demo start and end dates.
	_- check in the change to the branch
	_- Build a new gen_erate.exe [3]
-- Create a branch in svn [5] to hold all the "extra files" needed for the 
   BridgePoint build
    _- open the SVN Repositories view in eclipse
    _- create a branch in svn [5] with the same name used for the git branch
       (for example: v4.1.4Demo)
    _- from the svn repositories view, copy the following projects from trunk 
       and paste them into the new branch:
       apache-ant
       bp_build_tools
       BridgePoint_e<X.X>
       BridgePoint_for_Linux_e<X.X>
       eclipse
       extra_files_for_build
       mgls
       MIMIC
    _R The new branch is now created with all the files needed for the build 
       server.
   	
-- Checkin gen_erate.exe to the svn branch created above that the build server 
   will use to build the product.	
    _- check out the extra_files_for_build project from the svn branch 
    _- Copy the new gen_erate.exe into extra_files_for_build/gen_erate.exe and
       check this into the branch.
    	          
-- Copy the BridgePointDemo.txt file into place so it can be include in the 
   build of the installer.
   
   -- First we do this for the windows version of the tool
    _- check out BridgePoint_e<X.Y>/BridgePointDeliverables/license 
       from the svn branch.
       Note: We only check out this folder because the BridgePoint_e<X.Y> 
             project is HUGE and we don't need the whole thing.
    _- copy <git internal>BridgePointDemoKeyCreator/license_files_handed_out/BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> to 
       the "license" folder that was just checked out.
    _- rename BridgePointDemo.txt-<startdate>-thru-<enddate> to
	   BridgePointDemo.txt
	_- Check BridgePointDemo.txt into the branch	   
	_- delete the "license" project from your workspace

	-- Now repeat the above steps for Linux		
    _- Repeat the steps above, but instead of BridgePoint_e<X.Y>, use 
       BridgePoint_for_Linux_e<X.Y>
	   
_- Launch the branch build on the build server [6].
_R Build is successful

-- Test the installers
   _- Install the demo on Windows
   _- If any MGLS* or LM* environment variable exit in the test environment
      comment them out (simply rename them by adding "noForDemo" to their name). 
   _- Install BridgePoint 
   _- Launch the tool
   _R No license errors
   _- Use the Getting started demo to create MicrowaveOven
   _- Build MicrowaveOven with MC3020
   _R No errors
   _- Launch verifier and run MicrowaveOven
   _R No Errors
   _- Change the system date to 1 day after expiration
   _R License errors appear
   _- Restore the system date and any environment variable that were 
      commented-out in the first step.
   _- FYI (for internal testing), note that after hitting a license error with 
      the demo version the tool will continue to fail (with license errors) 
      until a new, clean, valid,copy of BridgePointDemo.txt is put into the 
      license folder.
   // Linux demo still not working
   //_- Install the demo on linux.  
   //   Note: You must install to: /usr/local/MentorGraphics
   //   To do this create the folder /usr/local/MentorGrpahics and change 
   //   ownership of that folder to user that will perform the installation.
   //_- Repeat the test steps that were performed for Windows
   
-- Archive the installer
  _- Open the location \\wv\dfs\bridgepoint\engineering releases
  _- Create a subdir with the release number and purpose
  _- Copy the Windows installer into this directory
  _- Copy the Linux installer into this directory
