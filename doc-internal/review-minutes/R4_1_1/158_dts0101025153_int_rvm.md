INT Review

-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   KB   3        "Users would would like to suppress these errors" add _for realized bridges_ or 
  _in some cases_
x- 02  min   BM   4.2      Add a second requirement that talks about the preference we are adding
x- 03  min   BM   5.1      Note where in the preference tree this will live.  Note it is project level and 
  not workspace level. Add this as a workspace preference as well.  Project will override the workspace setting
x- 04  min   KB   5.1      Add tooltip hover for the preference that adds verbosity to what the functionality will do
x- 05  min   BM   5.1.2    Reword because it currently states "A parse error will be created..."
x- 06  min   TL   5.2.1    Add paragraph for GPS Watch.  The EE had a hybrid OAL setup that has been modified.
x- 07  min   TL   general  Provide some text to Keith for the release notes about the rules
x- 08  min   BM   general  Share this note with Saab and get their input
x- 09  min   KB   7        Update to account for workspace and project preferences
x- 10  min   TL   general  Note that the Template project was modified as well as GPS and MO



Code Review (20140211 - Keith, Bob, Travis)
------------
x- Bridge Invocation::execute()  Change the error message to remove the double negative
x- Bridge Value::getValue()      Mirror the message change as done in Bridge Invocation::execute()
x- import_functions.inc          Look into the if-test on 193, maybe be more specific
x- ImportHelper:2997             Consider extending the if-test here to be smarter (add a check on the classpath?)
x- plugin_customization.ini      will use these now with workspace prefs.  There is a duplicate for allow_operations_in_where
x- PlaceHolderManage.java        The check on 733 and the fallout code on 743 looks wrong
x- GPSWatch/Location/.../ClassStateMachine  The change here around the apostrophe is strange

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
