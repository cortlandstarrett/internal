_- 12  min   CM   6.2     "Show more children" Disambiguate this statement by explaining
                          what additional information is to be shown.
_- 13  maj   KB   6       We should not make the Variables view behave differently than the
                          Session Explorer.
_- 14  maj   KB   6       Ideally we don't want any new modes or preferences, just one
                          consistent way for both SE and the Variables View to operate.
_- 15  maj   CM   6       Use cases are needed to decide if multiple modes are needed and
                          if so how they should operate.
_- 16  min   CM   6.3     Research old mechanism for showing referential values and assess
                          whether it should be fixed in preference to creating a new different
                          mechanism (consider how SE works and if the referential display
                          mechanism there can be leveraged).
_- 17  min   CM   6.4     Don't overload array syntax in Variables View.
_- 18  min   KB   6.3     Raise a separate issue for this since it is a bug rather than an
                          enhancement.
_- 19  min   KB   7       Ensure any new unit tests are added to Verifier test suite 2.
_- 20  maj   CM   Gen.    Recommend implementing only enhanced mode (6.1.2) for now so that
                          SE and Variables View are left consistent.
_- 21  min   CM   Gen.    Raise a separate issue to cover the rest of the enhanced
                          functionality and have it applied to both Session Explorer and the
                          Variables View.
