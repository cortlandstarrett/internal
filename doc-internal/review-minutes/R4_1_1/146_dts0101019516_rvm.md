x- 01  min   TRL  3         Duplicated 'number'
R- 02  maj   RM   6.3       Let SAAB know that re-parse will have a degradation
                            or special case Runtime Value
NOTE: Changed proposed solution does not have restart time regression, so SAAB
does not need to be informed.
x- 03  min   RM   6.3.2/6.5 Note that parse all twice in one session will have
                            the same degradation
