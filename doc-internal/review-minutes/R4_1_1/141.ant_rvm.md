x- 01     min   bob         2 [5-8]    These are place holders for follow on issues.  
                                       These place holders need to be filled out.
x- 02     min   bob         2 [5-8]    For process and planning we also need CQ issues for these items
x- 03     min   bob         4.1.2         will deliverable  > will be deliverable 
x- 04     min   CMC         4          Have time constraints between the various parts of the course.
                                       There are 6 parts, they are defined in [4] under the Proposal section. 
x- 05     min   CDC         6          Work required does not cover all items.  We have decided it is ok to
                                       delegate this to the design notes.
o- 06     min   bob         2          Consider having a separate issue for each of the 6 proposed training elements
                                       called out in the word document [4], so we have a clear deliverable for each.
CDS:  We will start with these 4 issues and continue from there.
									   
No major observations, a re-review is not required.
