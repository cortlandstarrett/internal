-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   T    1        he -> the
x- 02  min   B    3.2      in case -> in the case
x- 03  min   B    5.2.1    is one line -> is a one line
x- 04  min   B    5.2.1    Line with comprehensible reworded to:  The new view
                           is easier for the user to comprehend because it shows
                           ports and interfaces as they are shown in the
                           definition.
x- 05  min   B    5.2.2    changes -> change
x- 06  min   B    5.2.3    informations -> information
x- 07  min   T    5.2.3    The port reference must be supported in the
                           synchronization framework
x- 08  min   B    5.2.3    Remove "There will never be a case where the model
                           will have a CL_POR that is not formalized, therefore
                           the name used in the case when there is no associated
                           port is an empty string."
x- 09  min   B    5.2.3    Add that the derived attribute returns an empty
                           string if no port is found
x- 10  min   B    5.2.3    Remove "The final look of this solution will be the
                           same as the one presented in [5.2.1], without the
                           ability to modify the component port in multiple
                           places."
x- 11  min   T    6.3      Change wording to say "Modify verifier to use the new
                           traversals in all places"
x- 12  min   B    6.5      doesn't -> don't
x- 13  min   T    6.6      Change section to mention that the ooaofooa_hierarchy
                           data shall be changed, which will allow support for
                           the port reference in properties and compare.
x- 14  min   T    6.6      Add work to set the description marking of the Port
                           Reference.Name derived attribute to:
                           "Full Name: Port Name"
x- 15  min   T    6.7      Change section to mention that we will add a delete
                           menu item
x- 16  min   B    7.1      Remove this section
x- 17  min   B    7        Add a section stating: "For every item in the work
                           required section there should be an associated test.
                           A good amount of these may be automatically added
                           through generated tests."
