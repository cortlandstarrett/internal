Code review
x- 01  Runtime Value line 17, why does this use VIA.Index?  How is this different that then place that was modified later in the function?

Response: The reason tha this location is different is that this is used to show the actual index of "this" RuntimeValue
instance when the runtime value instance represents an array-type element.  It is not used to show the length.

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
