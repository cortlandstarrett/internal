-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   KB   6        The work for [4] is not called out anywhere.  Need to synchronize with Cort to 
  get the work done at the same time this is promoted.  We will have to rebuild generator. 
x- 02  min   KB   6.1.5    Clarify why this is a 1 to many even though BP does not support it
x- 03  min   TL   6.1.2    We should return the cached name instead of empty string if the referred to Port 
  instance does not exist
x- 04  min   TL   6.1.3    This is a many to one conditional.  It is conditional because a Port could be 
  removed and the Port Reference still exist before the user runs the synchronize tool.
x- 05  min   TL   8.2      Remove 8.2

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
