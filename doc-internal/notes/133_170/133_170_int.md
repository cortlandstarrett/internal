Introduce nightly build support  


3. Background
-------------
The issue described in [1] was complete when a high priority customer issue 
arrived [3]. The branch that contains the work for [1], 
133_dts0100798845_Dynamic_Array_Length_Bug, had a small changeset, and [3] was 
also not a large item, therefore [1]'s branch was used for [3] changes. This 
note calls out the changes made for [3], all changes made for [1] are described 
in that issue's  design note [2].  

The issue called out by [3] is that an innocuous error message is being reported 
during CLI builds.  The message is:  
"Content is not allowed in prolog."  

The problem is that when the customer is running from CLI, they may scan the 
log for errors, and they have no good way to know that this error message is 
innocuous. The customer asks that we investigate to determine the cause of this 
message and resolve the issue.  

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 The error message, "Content is not allowed in prolog.", will not be reported 
in the log file during builds.   

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1. Investigation into [3] reveals that the message the customer is seeing is 
caused by a file, ".gitignore",  that is in the customer's .extenalToolBuilders 
folder.  The root issue is that the builder is opening and attempting to parse 
all files that are in the .externalToolBuiders folder.  

Investigation revealed that the reason this is being done is to check projects 
to assure that the build settings are correct. This is being done as part of a 
fix for a bug the tool once had in it's default project settings [4].  

5.1.2 To resolve this issue the work that was done in [4] to search project 
settings to validate they are correct (and update them if not) is being removed. 
This resolves the problem, because we will no longer look inside the 
.externalToolBuiders folder during the build.  

5.1.3 This change does mean that any projects whose settings are not set as 
specified in [4] are subject to the problem called out in [4].  However, it is 
believed that it has been so long since that change was made to correct our 
default project settings that no such projects exist any longer.  

If projects do have this problem, they can use the prior version, BP 4.1.0, to   
upgrade, or they can upgrade manually.


6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None  

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1 This is a manual test for [3]. The test for [1] is called out in the design note [2]. 
* Put a file in the .extenalToolBuilders folder that is not a valid xml file
* Build the project
* Result - The project builds with no errors reported.
