# Breakpoint still around after removal
### xtUML Project Design Note


 
1. Abstract
-----------
 The verifier, after terminate and relaunch, still stops at a breakpoint that 
 was previously removed from the breakpoint view.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 239, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/239  
[2] CQ DEI dts0100722456 - Breakpoint still around after removal  



3. Background
-------------
3.1 Steps to reproduce the issue   
	_- Load the GPS watch from the welcome page  
	_- Set a break point on the 'refresh' event in the CBSM of Tracking::Tracking::Display  
	_- Launch the System component package in Verifier  
	_- Execute Tracking::UI::UI::startStopPressed  
	R- Execution stops on the one the above breakpoint  
	_- Terminate the Verifier session  
	_- Relaunch the Verifier session  
	_- Execute Tracking::UI::UI::startStopPressed  
	R- Execution stops on the one the above breakpoint  
	_- Remove the breakpoint from the Breakpoint view  
	_- Hit resume  
	R- Execution still breaks in the same location, the breakpoint will not be cleared until the BP is restarted.  
3.2 This issue used to be reproduced in 3.2.0 and 3.2.5 HEAD.   
This issue seems to be fixed in 3.2.2, though. But, again, is broken in HEAD.  
3.3 There was one possible explanation that the BPEventBreakpoint class needed to override 
Breakpoint.delete and actually remove the modeled breakpoint.   
3.4 The above suggested solution was implemented.  It removed the breakpoint 
    implementation and then delegated up to the supertype to get the UI elements taken care of. 
    This was tested and fixed the problem described by the customer.  
    There were additional places where this same problem could occur.  
    To resolve this for all situations, the above override of the delete 
    implementation was added to the BPBreakpoint.java abstract class.  
    Since deleteTargetBreakpoint() is an interface in the IBPBreakpoint class which 
    is implemented but not defined by this BPBreakpoint class, it gets called 
    by the appropriate derived breakpoint class for each case.  
3.5 This is happening again in BP 4.1.0 with states and events. 
    Ericsson has reported this.


4. Requirements
---------------
4. The verifier shall not stop at a breakpoint that is unchecked from the 
   breakpoint view.

   
5. Analysis
-----------
5.1 Unchecking a breakpoint from the breakpoint view does not trigger the call 
    for the method delete() in the BPBreakpoint.java abstract class.
	
5.2 When verifier is launched it creates modeled BreakPoint_c instances for the 
    existing BPBreakpoint instances.
	
5.3 Terminating the verifier session doesn't remove those modeled BreakPoint 
    instances.  
	
5.4 On verifier Relaunch each a corresponding modeled breakpoint_c is created for
    each existing BPBreakpoint, taking  into consideration the instances that 
	were created in the previous session were not removed at the termination this
	causes the existence of extra modeled breakpoint instances.    
5.5 The reason unchecking the breakpoint from the breakpoint view does not 
   affect the verifier behaviour is that the breakpoint instance being affected by the 
   change in the breakpoint view  is not the same instance that is being checked 
   for the verifier.  
   i.e. After one relaunch to a model with a single BPBreakpoint  
        there are two modeled breakpoint instances, one of them is controlled by 
		the breakpoint view and the other is checked by the verifier.
		The first gets disabled by unchecking it in the breakpoint view
		but the second is still enabled and it causes the verifier to stop.  
        
	

6. Design
---------
6.1 While terminating the Verifier session all instances of the modeled BreakPoint 
    instances are collected for each model root and get disposed.  
6.2 A method removeBreakPoints() is added to BPDebugTarget java class
    This method gets passed one parameter of type ModelRoot.    
	The method retrieves instances list for the type Breakpoint_c.class, then
	disposes these instances one by one.  
	
6.3 A call to the above method gets added to the method terminate() in BPDebugTarget 
    The call is added in the termination loop.    



7. Design Comments
------------------
When BridgePoint is restarted, it is required to remember and reinstate previously existing breakpoints.
This BP persistence is done through the Eclipse breakpoint storage mechanism.
So deleting these BreakPoint_c instances does not affect BridgePoints ability to restore breakpoints both across Verifier sessions and across tool restarts.


8. Unit Test
------------
8.1 Add two tests to the verifier test suite that does the following:  
8.1.1  
_- Load the GPS watch from the welcome page  
_- Set a break point on the 'refresh' event in the CBSM of Tracking::Tracking::Display  
_- Launch the System component package in Verifier  
_- Execute Tracking::UI::UI::startStopPressed  
R- Execution stops on the one the above breakpoint  
_- Terminate the Verifier session  
_- Relaunch the Verifier session  
_- Execute Tracking::UI::UI::startStopPressed  
R- Execution stops on the one the above breakpoint  
_- Remove the breakpoint from the Breakpoint view  
_- Hit resume  
R- Execution does not break in the same location    
8.1.2  
_- Load the GPS watch from the welcome page  
_- Set a break point on the 'stopped' state of GPS Watch::Library::Tracking::Tracking::WorkoutTimer from CME  
_- Execute the "GPS Watch With Initializer" debug configuration  
R- Execution stops on the above breakpoint  
_- Terminate the Verifier session  
_- Relaunch the Verifier session  
R- Execution stops on the one the above breakpoint  
_- Remove the breakpoint from the Breakpoint view  
_- Hit resume  
R- Execution does not break in the same location    
8.2 Run Verifier test suite.
