the version number of BridgePoint.

None.

[1] Issue 3203. http://phoenix.projtech.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3203

Background
----------
It is the policy of the BridgePoint development team to update the version
number of BridgePoint with each external delivery of the code.  This mostly
involves updating the plug-in version numbers.

Intended Audience
-----------------
This document is intended for the BridgePoint development team.

Steps
-----
x- Turn off Build Automatically if it is turned on
x- Update your development workspace with the latest version from github master
   of all plug-in and support projects (e.g. Installer_MIP_MIMIC and utilities)
x- Create an issue in github for the version bump.
x- Branch the xtuml/internal repository.
x- Edit bp.internal.tools/update_BP_version.xml to contain the new version and
   commit this to the issue used for the version bump.
x- Right-click update_BP_version.xml, select "Run As > Ant Build"
x- Go to the bp.doc plug-in and search under that plug-in for the old version 
   number(example: 1.5.1)
xR Several html files are found
   Note: The locationss are:
		com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc
			license
				oss.htm
					229: directory&gt;\eclipse_extensions\BridgePoint\eclipse\plugins\com.mentor.nucleus.bp.doc_4.2.0</span><span  
		ReleaseNotes
			HTML
				ReleaseNotes.htm (5 matches)
					281: 4.2.0</span></p>  
					430: style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> BridgePoint 4.2.0  
					450: 4.2.0 is fully data compatible with workspaces and projects created with  
					451: BridgePoint 3.7.0 and xtUML.orgï¿½s xtUML Editor 3.7.2.&nbsp; BridgePoint 4.2.0  
					631: color:black'>BridgePoint 4.2.0</span></b></p>  
		WhatsNew
			HTML
				WhatsNew.htm
					200: BridgePoint 4.2.0</span></p>  
O- Copy the new version (ex 1.5.2)  to the Windows Clipboard
O- Work through the Search view in Eclipse and for each match found open the 
   file in MS Word and update the version using MS Word.
   
       IMPORTANT: 
         1) Do not update any HTML file versions inside eclipse.  Navigate
            to the file on disk and edit the file with MS Word.
         2) The Release Notes and What's New files should be written with 
            MS Word "Save As..." as type "Web Page, Filtered"
Note: The above 2 steps were not performed because we will move away from MS 
      Word for the next release.  For now these docs will simply continue to
      refer to 4.2.0
                        
x- Select all projects in the workspace, refresh them to pick up the changes
xR Version update is now complete, all files that must be modified are now
   "dirty" in your workspace.   
x- Use "Team > Synchronize Workspace" to compare the locally changed projects 
   with the root of the branch.  Use the code change scraper to get the list of 
   changed files.  
x- Commit and push the files changed with this work.  Record the changed files
   list in the commit message.  As always, commit against the issue for this
   task.
x- Create a pull request for the branch.
x- Merge the pull request.

End
