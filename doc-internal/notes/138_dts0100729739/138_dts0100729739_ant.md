Display the port name instead of the interface name in the explorer view for a 
referenced component
### xtUML Project Analysis Note
 

1. Abstract
-----------
One customer believes it is much more useful to know the port of a component instead of the interface.  
If for example the component has multiple ports of the same interface, these can not be distinguished in the explorer view.  
This issue is rasied to resolve this problem in a way that is appropriate for all customers.

Upgrade model compilers to consider the new element Port Reference
	
3. Background
-------------
3.1 In the tree representation for the xtuml model, a port is shown as a child tree node to that of a component.
In the case of a component reference, the child nodes represent interface references of the formalized port.  

3.2 In the case of having a component with multiple ports formalized to the same interface, and having 
    a component reference assigned to that component, the user might find it confusing while expanding
    the component reference instance in the tree view.
    There will show multiple interface references of the same name under the component reference  
    without showing their related ports names.
    There's an image to show this case in [3].  

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Display the port name along with the interface name in the explorer view for
    a referenced component

 
5. Analysis
-----------
5.1  There is a problem with the current way interface names are displayed in the 
     tree view.  The case where a component has multiple ports formalized to 
     the same interface looks bad, and is ambiguous (see [3]).

5.2 There are three ways to get this problem resolved:  

5.2.1 Make the port tree node show directly under the component reference in the ME tree view.  	
      The changes needed for this solution is a one line change in the file ui.explorer/sql/UITree.pei.sql. This file will be modified to include the port of the component definition as a child of the component reference.  
      The hover text on the imported interface references will show the port name. Since we have this workaround in the graphics this modification might be enough.  
      The problem of this solution is that the port will now be showing in two places and modification will be allowed in both places. We have the same issue with operations and signals that are used in interface references. SAAB does not want to allow modification at that lower level, so we at least need to consider this.  
      The good thing about this solution is, it's a very limited change doesn't involve any meta-model modification. It just involves how the tree points to the port instance as opposed to imported requirement/imported provision elements. It only changes how it's displayed in the tree view.  The new view is easier for the user to comprehend because it shows ports and interfaces as they are shown in the definition.  
      The end result will look like the following:

5.2.2 Modify the tree node of the imported requirement/imported provision that shows under the component reference, to show the port name along with the interface name.  
The change needed for this solution is adding an if statement to the ui.explorer/arc/create_label_provider.inc file.  Consequently the method getText() will return a different result in case of imported requirement/imported provision elements.  
The result will be in the form portName::InterfaceName. Displaying the portName will be optional, it will be controlled by a preference that defaults to true. If that preference is set to false the port name will not show.  

The end result will look like the following:

5.2.3 Introduce new model element Port Reference. This is a new class, with new data for explorer, properties and probably ui.text.
      This new element will capture all the needed information and would serve as a child for the component reference the same way Port is a child to component. It will have a representation in the model explorer view as a tree node that is a child to the component reference node.  
      This class is named "Port Reference", It has class letters "CL_POR". This class has a derived attribute "Name" that displays the name of the referenced port,the derived attribute returns an empty string if no port is found.    
      This element is present only when a component reference is assigned to a component,hence there is no graphical representation to the element. The element in not allowed to be created manually neither by using the palette, right click on canvas nor from the tree view. The port reference must be supported in the synchronization framework.     
      This change needs a multi-file modifications plus all of the maintenance OAL for needed for setting up the instances and disposing them.  
      
	  
5.3 The Proposed solution is the one explained in 5.2.3   
    The work required for this solution is detailed below in section[6]    	

6. Work Required
----------------
6.1 Add a new class to the meta model to represent the port reference 
    This class is named "Port Reference", It has class letters "CL_POR"  
    This class has a derived attribute "Name" that displays the 
    name of the referenced port.  

6.2 Upgrade parser traversals to use port reference where needed    

6.3 Modify verifier to use the new traversals in all places.  

6.4 Upgrade the io.mdl plugin to adjust the import and export to consider the new element. 
    So that the newly created models containing instances of port references gets properly exported
and imported.  

6.5 Create upgrade functionality to upgrade old models that don't have this element present.  
The new element will be added automatically wherever it is needed.  
Each occurence of a component reference assigned to acomponent with ports
will get the corresponding Port Reference elements created.  

6.6 The ooaofooa_hierarchy data shall be changed, the Port Reference meta-model class will be added which will allow support the port reference in properties and compare. Set the description marking of the PortReference.Name derived attribute to: "Full Name: Port Name"  

6.7 Add a delete menu item for the context menu entries of the new element.    

6.8 Upgrade model compilers to consider the new element if needed.   
    A separate issue will be raised to address this part[4].  
 

7. Acceptance Test
------------------
 
7.1 For every item in the work required section there should be an associated test. A good amount of these may be automatically added through generated tests.  
7.2 Add new JUnit test to test the appearance of the "Port Reference" in the tree view  
7.3 Add new JUnit to test the model upgrade functionality for the old models make sure they don't get corrupted
