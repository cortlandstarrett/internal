# Verifier Performance Enhancement
### xtUML Project Implementation Note

1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the implementation of the selected solution to a reported
Verifier performance problem.

    of functions make Verifier extremely slow

3. Background
-------------
See [3].

4. Requirements
---------------
See [3].

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1 Create two new classes which inherit from InstanceList, StaticInstanceList
    and RuntimeInstanceList.

5.2 Take the implementation of the contains() and remove(Object, Object) methods
    and move them to StaticInstanceList.

5.3 Make the two methods in 5.2 abstract in InstanceList.

5.4 Provide implementations for the two methods in RuntimeInstanceList that
    traverse the instance extent backwards as discussed in [3].

5.5 Modify ModelRoot.getInstanceList to return either a StaticInstanceList or
    a dynamic one based on a static final list of class types. List to contain
    all classes defined in OOA of OOA Runtime Value package.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
None.

7. Unit Test
